quarter , ending February 28 , profits may be below the 2.4 mln dlrs , or 15 cts a share , earned in the first quarter of fiscal 1986 .

plan , initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy , is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices , widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis . Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices , fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country 's 250 pct inflation rate . But within a year the plan has all but collapsed . " The situation now is worse than it was . Although there was inflation , at least the economy worked , " a leading bank economist said . The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account . In 1984 and 1985 Brazil 's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt . For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat , with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs . But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln . Reuter

shortly from the Government Accounting Office ( GAO ) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays , administration and industry sources said . Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments , a GAO official told Reuters . GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) , former chairman of the senate agriculture committee . The report , which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash , is scheduled to be released in mid March . The cost of certificates , said the GAO source , depends on the program 's impact on the USDA loan program . If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures , then the net cost of the program would go up . However , if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease , the cost effect of certificates would be less . GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded , the GAO official said . But a negative report on certificates " will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program , " an agricultural consultant said . The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program , while USDA remains firmly committed to it . Reuter

scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices , oil industry analysts said . " The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought . They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems , " said Daniel Yergin , director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , CERA. Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets . " O PEC 's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way , " said Paul Mlotok , oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. He said the market 's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices . But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December . " OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas , fixed prices and set differentials , " said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named . " The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again ," he added . David T. Mizrahi , editor of Mideast reports , expects OPEC to meet before June , although not immediately . However , he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems . " They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil , but in late March and April when demand slackens , " Mizrahi said . But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd . " Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC 's ability to hold together prices and output . " OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then , " said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York . But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University 's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production . " Demand for their ( OPEC ) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production , " he told Reuters in a telephone interview .

actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program ( EEP ) , senior USDA officials said . However , grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made , though not in the very near future . " The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again ," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said . " But there just is n't much talk about it , informally or formally . " Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets , even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week . But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , it could take several months . " I just do n't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process , " the aide to Lyng said . " An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight , " said one former USDA official , who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program . An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress , a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets . But Lyng 's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday , House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time . The administration 's interagency trade policy review group , comprised of subcabinet-level officials , has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP , officials at the U.S. Trade Representative 's Office said . In their talks this week , the two sides discussed the administration 's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative . One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of " calm , basic , factual economics . " Another USDA official said there was " not even an informal suggestion or hint " that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms . USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair .

The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses , they said . The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank , People 's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates , the sources said . However , it was impossible for them to follow the last cut , to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28 , because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct .

On Tuesday , the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct , effective February 28 .

by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987 , against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines , the U.S. Embassy said in a report . Production of Indonesia "s staple food , rice , is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986 , according to the annual report on Indonesia "s agricultural performance . The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes , with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987 . The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks . " Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane , rubber and copra show little or no gain , " the report says . " The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans , palm oil and palm kernels . " Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds , limited fertile land , insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops , the report underlines . The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as " wereng " or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields . The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties , and to use lower-yielding , more resistant rice types . The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee , tea , rubber , plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices . Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln , with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986 , the report says . But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 ( Oct-Sept ) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87 , imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant . The report says that imports of wheat , soybeans , soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September "s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand . The report said that Indonesia "s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate , the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s . It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984 . The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump . REUTER

published today , said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices . Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying " None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting . " He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily ( bpd ) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation . Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December . They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates , along with the much smaller producer Ecuador , among those producing above quota . Kuwait , they said , was pumping 1.2 mln bpd . " This rumour is baseless . It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share . They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability , it will do so , " the minister said . Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd . " If we can sell more than our quota at official prices , while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share , it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever , " he said . He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar , which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota , because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel . Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel . Sheikh Ali also delivered " a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices . " Because it was charging its official price , of 16.67 dlrs a barrel , it had lost custom , he said but did not elaborate . However , Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad , he added . He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC "s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the bod y "s members . Ecuador "s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude , and was to seek this at talks this month of opec "s pricing committee . Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members , in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar , he said " We expected such pressure . It will continue through March and April .

political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy , the U.S. Embassy says in a new report . To counter falling oil revenues , the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment . Indonesia , the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer , has been severely hit by last year "s fall in world oil prices , which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September . But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto "s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy . " ( It ) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation , both as it pertains to investments and imports , " the report says . It primarily assesses Indonesia "s agricultural sector , but also reviews the country "s general economic performance . It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation , "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves . " " This group strongly favours an import substitution economy ," the report says . Indonesia "s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction , though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected , and virtual monopolies . Three sets of measures have been announced since last May , which broadened areas for foreign investment , reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports . The report says Indonesia "s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero , and the economy may even have contracted a bit . " This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960 s , " the report notes . Indonesia , the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million , is facing general elections in April .

Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry .

steady at yesterday 's higher levels in a quiet market . Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices . Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation . A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity .

slightly from last year 's decline in world oil prices , announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals . The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86 . In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today , Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Ab dul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period . Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals . Sheikh Ab dul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals , down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion . The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues . Sheikh Ab dul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year 's allocations minus 15 pct . He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure . He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered . Sheikh Ab dul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country 's foreign reserves . He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings , social services , health , education , transport and communications , electricity and water , industry and agriculture . No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security . There was also no projection for oil revenue . Qatar , an OPEC member , has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day . Sheikh Ab dul-Aziz said "Our expectations of positive signs regarding ( oil ) price trends , foremost among them OPEC 's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth , have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year 's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota .

well during the past decade , but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind , <Gulf International Bank BSC> ( GIB ) said . The bank 's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate , foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals . " Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts , " he said . The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories money markets , stock and bond markets . Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities . " N evertheless , bond and stock markets remain , to a large extent , fragmented and lagging behind , " he said . Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues . Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange , while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges . But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf , governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges , Azzam said . He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had " clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region . " In addition , family firms are reluctant to go public , financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth . A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery . Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities ' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets . He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments . Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) states Bahrain , Kuwait , Qatar , Oman , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . Some moves had been taken in this direction , with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies . Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia . But he added there is " no bond market to speak of " in Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Oman or the UA E , with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978 . While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up , establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar , Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent , Azzam said .

reiterated the kingdom 's commitment to last December 's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market , the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said . Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices , Nazer said Saudi Arabia " is fully adhering by the Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance . " Nazer , quoted by SPA , said recent pressure on free market prices " may be because of the end of the ( northern hemisphere ) winter season and the glut in the market . " Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord , under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel . The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets , which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-198 6 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985 . Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs . Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia 's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market . He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord . In Jamaica , OPEC President Rilwanu Lu kman , who is also Nigerian Oil Minister , said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement . " We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market , but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions , " he said . Kuwait 's Oil Minister , Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah , said in remarks published in the emi rate 's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices . Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling .

auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24 , President Kenneth Kaunda said . " We have not run away from the auction . It has n't been abolished at all ," he told Reuters in an interview . He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and , he hoped , would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds . Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate . Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government 's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand . It was suspended when the kwacha 's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector , he said . Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985 . The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months . In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders , and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar .

to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) from 3.8 mln bpd in January , Gulf oil sources said . They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju 'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers . But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week , the sources said . The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage , which are generally considered part of a country 's output for Opec purposes . Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel . The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end . Last week 's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia 's main crude customers , the four ex-partners of Aramco , the sources said . The four Exxon Corp <XON> , Mobil Corp <MOB> , Texaco Inc <TX> and Chevron Corp <CHV> signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel . However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia 's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month , when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off . Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels . Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom 's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices . The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries . They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month , compared to zero in January , while throughput at Bahrain 's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each .

trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other . The talks , held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations , will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz 's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China . Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure , the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus , U.S. Officials said . " We appreciate their frustration , " a senior Japanese government official said . " But we are also frustrated . " The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard , forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad . That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade , but it will , he said . He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress . " It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments , " a senior U.S. Official replied . The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance , which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan 's fav our . On the following two days , the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers . The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials . Tomorrow 's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing , and the implications of government budget deficits . These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government , which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more . Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports , as Washington wants . Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance . That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports . Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices . " It condemns Japan without due process , " one Japanese official said . That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen , he said . Japan is also not totally happy with the administration 's trade bill , particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S. , Officials said . Nevertheless , Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position , especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them . " We have no leverag e , " one official admitted . As a result , Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields , including super computers . The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market . The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers , officials said .

Wang Chao-Ming , vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development , told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year . Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper .

The United States , Taiwan 's main trading partner , has said the island 's import tariffs , still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct , were unacceptable . It has criticised the cuts as too selective . Taiwan 's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year . The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs , which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism . Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan 's position in talks with Washington over export quotas , particularly for shoes , textiles and machine tools which are among the island 's main export-earners . A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles . Under the accord , Taiwan 's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988 .

If the latest French requests are accepted as expected , this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes . The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries . Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland , Austria and Lichtenstein , Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne , while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 a tonne .

should increase its strategic petroleum reserve to one mln barrels as one way to deal with the present and future impact of low oil prices on the domestic oil industry . U.S. policy now is to raise the strategic reserve to 750 mln barrels , from its present 500 mln , to help protect the economy from an overseas embargo or a sharp price rise . The Aspen Institute for Humanistic Stu dies , a private group , also called for new research for oil exploration and development techniques . It predicted prices would remain at about 15-18 dlrs a barrel for several years and then rise to the mid 20s , with imports at about 30 pct of U.S. consumption . The study cited two basic policy paths for the nation to protect the U.S. industry through an import fee or other such device or to accept the full economic benefits of cheap oil . But the group did not strongly back either option , saying there were benefits and drawbacks to both . It said instead that such moves as increasing oil reserves and more exploration and development research would help to guard against or mitigate the risks of increased imports . Reuter

to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers , U.S. government and farm group representatives said . The deadline for a final determination is March 7 . U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports . In that case , Canada decided pasta imports , which take about ten pct of the Canadian market , did not injure domestic producers . U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market . Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986 , but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated .

In a Vancouver address , Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker , but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded . The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel . said before the contract can be awarded Versatile " will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work . " Crosibie said Versatile 's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment . Work on the vessel , which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world , would begin next year and completed in 1992 . The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard 's vessel , the Polar Sea , through the disputed Northwest Passage . The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey , claiming the area was an international water way . The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country 's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic . Reuter

April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide . On April one , NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate , after the exchange closes , a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market , according to an exchange spokeswoman . " This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world , " said said Thomas McKiernan , McKiernan and Co chairman . Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices , McKiernan explained . The expanded program " will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does , " said Frank Capozza , secretary of Century Resources Inc. The rule change , which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYM EX , is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures , according to traders and analysts . Currently , at least one trader in this transaction , called an exchange for physical or EFP , must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction . Under the new arrangement , neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day , according to exchange officials . When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December , NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden , said , " Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for , in effect , 24-hour trading .

of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence , a public policy study group said " It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period , when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world , " the Washington-based Atlantic Council said . U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries , the world 's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually . The council 's study said the trade talks , with a deadline of October for an agreement , are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations . The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties . The council said " in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement , fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population . " But at the same time , it added , Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world . The council said that in the talks , Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against allegedly subsidized exports . A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized . The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking , insurance , telecommunications , and the so-called " cultural industrie s " publishing , broadcasting and films . It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation , " acid rain " and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage . Reuter

largest chemical company in the United Kingdom , will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year , and better its 1986 results , said chairman-elect Denys Henderson . " We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base , " Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here . ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company , ICI Pharma , which , with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit , it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990 . Henderson said , "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo 's ( Glaxo Holdings PLC ) does not . " ICI 's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs , which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits . He estimated that by 1990 , ICI 's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits . " The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return , " said A.W. Clements , finance director of ICI , who was also at the meeting . Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors . ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one . Henderson said the major new products in the company 's pipeline , expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually , were Statil , a treatment for diabetic complications , Zoladex , a treatment for advanced prostate cancer , and Carwin , a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure . Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex , both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK> , is not expected until about 1989 . ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year . Henderson said the company 's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs , but he declined to specify by how much . Henderson said 1987 's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints , which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions . Last year the company made 40 acquisitions , the largest being Glidden . He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as " too expensive . " Henderson said that in his new role of chairman , effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire , the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses .

must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed , two U.S. wheat organizations said . The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions , " but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions " on world grain trade , the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers , NAWG , and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter . Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities , a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved , and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be , the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments . Australia 's proposals , which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and " quarantine " U.S. wheat stocks , would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers , they said . Other countries , including Australia , have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs , the organizations said . " We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically and subsidize foreign wheat production by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers , " Jim Miller , president of NAWG said . " We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world 's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture , " Miller said . Reuter

goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said . With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year , the same rate as last year , unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-198 8 , from its present 10.9 pct , it said in an annual review of the French economy . The report said the French economy was " increasingly ill-adapted to deman d " selling goods at " uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets . " " France 's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average And ...A substantial loss of market share ...In the past 18 months , " it said . Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986 , it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to " a ( re newed ) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries . " This could result in further major losses of market share , particularly in the non-OECD area , which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports , it said . Until the competitive ability of industry improved , the authorities would have " little scope for macroeconomic manoeu v re , even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly , " it added . But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands , contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next , the OECD said . Written mainly in December last year , the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987 , and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices , caused partly by the government 's deregulation of service sector tariffs . " We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises , and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost , " one OECD official commented . OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report , indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct . The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct , against last year 's 2.1 pct . But the OECD backed the government 's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year , with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year 's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation . With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area , the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival , West Germany , could fall to just one pct this year , it said . On the other hand , the report noted , consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits . " For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability , it is essential that wage restraint continue , " it said .

Industry ( MITI ) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade , but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness . A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters . Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate , but those without it will not automatically be denied licences , he said . But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak . U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement . Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers , who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement . The MITI spokesman said , " If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company , it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means . In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure . " MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987 , spokesmen for the firms said . But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move .

remove curbs on its exports , to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology . But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports . The official International Business newspaper today published China 's demands in a editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz . " It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports , provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports , " the editorial said . " The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference ( GSP ) . " Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years , control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countrie s , " it added The paper also printed an article by China 's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy , Chen Shibiao , who said that " all kinds of difficulties and restrictions " were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential . He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour , curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation . The paper also printed a table showing that , since bilateral trade began in 1972 , China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977 . It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs . A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking 's trade figures at all , mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin . He said that , if China wants to obtain GSP status , it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status . The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP , China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , for which it applied in July 1986 , and " not be dominated or controlled by international Communism . " The official said China was well aware of the laws , some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950 's , but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them . China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years , which the U.S. Side won , he said . But , for the first time , China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods , which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case , he added . Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking 's application to GATT . " China has the potential to disrupt world markets , especially in textiles . Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect . But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT , " the diplomat said . Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China 's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports . In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian , U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China 's interest in participating in GATT . " The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese typ e , " Shultz said . " China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide . China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation , " he said . The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs , especially for exports , and a de facto dual currency system . In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month , China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with " guidance planning " and economic levers . The diplomat said that , to join GATT , China had much to do . REUTER

He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil .

He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987 . He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting .

Little progress was made in last night 's three hours of talks , with both sides largely reiterating their positions . " There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV , and I ca n't say that we expect to reach any agreement . But at least we are still talking , " a union spokesman said . Employers organization chairman , Jacques Schoufour , accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months . " The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all . " " If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector , then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month , " Schoufour said .

difficult times after a boom last year , and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit , President Daniel Arap Moi said . In a speech at the state opening of parliament , Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct , compared with 4.1 pct in 1985 . The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985 , he added . " But both these factors are no longer in our favour As a result , we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year , " he said . The price of coffee , Kenya 's main source of foreign exchange , fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986 . Crude oil , which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel , has since crept back to over 18 dlrs . Moi said the price changes , coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world , made it more difficult to finance the government 's budget deficit . Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history , he added . " This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts , and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development , " he said .

Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern , adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services . The department 's annual report for the year ended March 31 , 1986 , showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before , while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg .

Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan 's support . He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget .

There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year . Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal , but it did not include general tax increases . On trade issues , Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection .

Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point , but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems , analysts said . But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans , analysts of the Soviet Union said . " From a weather standpoint , you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop ( than last year ) ," Gail Martell , chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said . The next six weeks in the USSR 's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops , Martell and other analysts said . " Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us ," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said . The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill . This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years , the USDA analyst said . With a timely spring , Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops , but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower . Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures . This winter , however , snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent , so the bulk of winterkill , analysts speculate , likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination . " Fall dryness may be a problem . There 's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness , " Martell said . Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine , and below normal over the entire winter crop area , she said . Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill , Jim Candor , senior forecaster for Accu Weather , said . Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter , analysts said . The dry fall damaged pastures , the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding , they said . " The Soviets are not in a desperate situation they do n't have to buy ( grains ) now ," a USDA official said . But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year 's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions , more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies , he said . Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market , weather analysts said . " A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half , " Martell said .

over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia 's determined effort to support prices , analysts said . " The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market , hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting , " said Sanford Margoshes , oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. " But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating , " he added . Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december . The analysts said that to get others to hold the line , Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers ' meeting the previous week . The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil , analysts said . " They are trying to make sure that no one discounts , and to prevent that , it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales , " Margoshes said . He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales . Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar , which has had trouble selling oil . But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts . Analysts said that Saudi Arabia , with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lu kman , was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart . Daniel McKinley , oil analyst with Smith Barney , Upham Harris and Co said , " both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rall y . " He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo , which refused discounts to Japanese buyers , brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions . Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai , which sent prices up on Mideast sours , with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market . Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments . North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs , up one dlr . OPEC members ' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions . Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level . " The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result , " Margoshes said . Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally . Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount . But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors , including demand , which could cut the rally short . Marion Stewart , an indepedent petroleum economist , said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986 .

corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs . Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985 , it said . Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs , respectively , USDA said . The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments . Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate , or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year September-J anuary . National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum . Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel , based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate . Sorghum producers ' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel , based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate . The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law , the department said . Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates , the department said . The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices , it said . Reuter

reimburse the Australian Wheat Board , AWB , about 132 mln ( U.S. ) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains , the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne . For example the recent large sales of wheat to China ( 1.5 mln tonnes ) and Egypt ( 2.0 mln tonnes ) were well below the breakeven export price , it said . Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price , GMP , calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years , the department said . In addition , deductions for taxes , freight , handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives . But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics , BA E , predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90 . The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports , the department said . Reuter

other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas , said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer . Wellemeyer , speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference , also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong . " Over the next few weeks I think you 'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down , " Wellemeyer said . " The Saudis are committed to that price level ( of 18 dlrs a barre l ) and are willing to make it happen again ," he said . In recent weeks , oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota , pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day . But prices rebounded today , with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output . Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993 . Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices , Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies . The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day , or 18 pct of the world demand for oil . Reuter

75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat , it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains . EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 ( July-June ) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season , it said . The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board , BWB , expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year . The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production , and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand , the USDA said . It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes , but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago .

indications , the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains , the department said South Africa 's corn exports in the 1986/87 ( Oct-Sept ) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes , up 40 pct from the previous year . The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts , which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84 , it said . Since those imports in 1983/84 , the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan . But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies , purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated , the department said . Reuter

analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings , prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets . Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program . That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low . Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage , but they have no price guarantees . With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal , traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans , even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances . An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop , means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized , traders said . Here too , acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats , due to the more attractive deal from the government , they added . Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago , which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton . One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans , which are easier to grow , one commercial trader said .

Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions , said Thomas Jasper , the Association 's co-ch airman . The contract , unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient , he said . " The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation , " Japsper said . Privately , eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap . An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers , usually acting through a bank middleman , agree to accept each other 's interest payments on debt securities . Usually , the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice vers a . But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower . Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman , usually a bank , takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it . Kenneth McCormick , a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc , said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps . The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions . McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a " level playing fiel d " be maintained in the swaps market . He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice , the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers . The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules . He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort . That code should be completed within the next few weeks , he said . REUTER

this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels , director-general of the INFE export institute , Apolonio Ruiz Ligero , said . " The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now ," he said . " This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy , which have a similar productive structur e , " he said . The plan calls for providing soft loans , tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain 's presence in international trade fairs . Consumer goods such as fashion and wine , as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted . Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan , while the government 's development aid fund ( FAD ) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant . The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year . Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand , which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985 . He added that 80 pct of Spain 's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) countries . The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year . The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. " The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition , " he said . He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand , while turning their backs on foreign markets . " They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation , " he said .

unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank 's loans and other assets . Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England . The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan . The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps , forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments . Previously , the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain . Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank 's minimum capital needs . The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank 's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure . The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset , which would reflect the replacement cost . Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators . Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset . The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simpl icity . They ignore , for example , the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts . Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks , which are the principal participants in these types of activities . They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets . However , the staff concluded , " The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations . " The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market , on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs . Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges . Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules . Reuter

social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products , EC Commission sources said . The ministers agreed that under this " extensification " scheme , farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct . The plan would initially apply to cereals , beef , veal and wine , they added . Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage , while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield . In each case , farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC . The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego . The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment . It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops . At present such allowances are available only for livestock . The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques , the sources added . At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers . Andriessen did not give full details , but said member state aid would be subject to " strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition . " EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production . The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay " early retiremen t " pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production . Those who took their land completely out of farm production , rather than passing it on to their heirs , would have received more generous payments . Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed . Reuter

Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets , the Bank of England said . The plan , covering swaps , forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates , complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy , the proposal said . It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals . The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma .

" At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures . In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets , the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct , depending on the quality of the counterparty , the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract , the plans showed . The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts . They would , however , be reflected in the assignment of risk weights . The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or , in the U.S. , By domestic national government agencies , the proposals showed . The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges . It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to " net " contracts consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream .

survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April , the Polish meteorology institute said . Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters . Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February , air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful , she said , but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April , when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts .

Argentina 's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Sunflower , maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected , they said . But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May . The rains did no damage to maize , sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year 's harvest . Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires , with the heaviest rains in the province 's western sectors , between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba , 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa , 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe , 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios , five and 40 mm in Misiones , and five and 50 mm in San Luis . No rain was recorded in Corrientes , Chaco and Formosa . Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week 's estimates . Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe , though slowly . Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area , compared to five to seven pct last week . Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares , or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest . Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes , or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates , or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year 's volume , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area . Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest , down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year 's figure of 3.14 mln hectares . Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes , which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest . Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area , which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest . Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes , or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86 . Soybean production , by contrast , is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes , which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year 's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes , according to private estimates . Official figures put last year 's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes . Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition , helped by abundant rains and high temperatures . Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares , up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year 's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares . Reuter

intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat , feedgrains , cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments , regardless of how much they planted . Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs , including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments , 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton . The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body . Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme . If payments are not set in advance under decoupling , market prices conceivably could rise , thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments . Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D- Vt. , said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue , but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it .

deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs , well over target , but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields , Ali Tigrel , director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said . He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct , up from 5.1 pct in 1985 , which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand . Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year . This year 's target of 20 pct " might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful , " he said . Tigrel , whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government 's economic planning , said Turkey 's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall , originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs . " We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years ," he added . His comment echoed last October 's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey , which said Ankara 's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus . " In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments , we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit , " he said . Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits . Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained . " We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations , " he said . It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986 . More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted , Tigrel said . Measures were being taken to encourage exports , and production incentives were being considered . " We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years . The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned , " Tigrel said . He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies , begun in 1980 , was still under way . Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied , but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible .

likely to continue at last year 's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices , industry analysts said . Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick , heavy and expensive to extract , oil prices would have to increase to near 1985 's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling , they said . " Companies will probably only drill their best prospects , " said John Curti , an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. Few new wells now are being drilled . Only 33 rigs , about one-quarter of the total available , were drilling for oil onshore in California last week , compared to about 70 last year , said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services , which tracks California drilling activity . " It 's in the dregs right now ," said Bolster of the state 's drilling activity . Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling , said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association . While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year , prices eventually fell . Prices for California 's marker grade , Line 63 blend , have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs . More than half of California 's oil comes from stripper wells , those producing less than 10 barrels a day , and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract , Malmgreen said . " It 's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs , " Malmgreen said . Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil , and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick , heavy oil , he said . The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now , analysts said . In the heart of California 's oil patch , Kern County , which produces about two-thirds of the state 's oil , exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl . Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986 , compared to 137 in 1985 , according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission . So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled . " I do n't think they 'll even get to what they did last year , " Mitchell said . No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade , Mitchell said . Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production . Between February and October of 1986 , the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000 , said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission . In line with that decrease , California 's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level , analysts said . Between February and October 1986 , California 's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd , Guerard said . Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls , compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983 , according to the California Department of Conservation . " Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels , " Guerard said . Reuter

" The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill . A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years .

the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat , oats , and barley in the crop year beginning August 1 , a board spokesman said . The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers . " They 're all lower , " he said . " This is really getting pretty serious . We 're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it 's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop . " Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices . Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board . If the wheat board , which markets most of Canada 's grain , obtains higher than expected prices on world markets , the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year . If prices are lower , the federal treasury makes up the difference . The final decision on the initial prices , usually made in April , rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet . Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts . But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year . Reuter

Nu gent , saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act , today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells . Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers . His proposal to revitalize Texas ' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state 's 4.6 pct severance tax . He said that the majority of Texas ' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production . Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves . Secondary and tertiary oil production , expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil , should also be exempted from the severance tax , Nugent said . His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years , or until the price of oil reaches $ 25 a barrel . " We 've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow . I say we have waited long enough , " Nugent said . " In other words , let 's tell Washington to either lead , follow , or get out of the way .

banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry , swap dealers said . After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board , dealers said that in effect , regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk . Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals . Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets , which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine . While no firm figures exist , dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement . Separately , the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding . Kenneth McCormick , co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association ( ISDA ) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc , said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals . " What they are proposing is really double counting , " Patrick de Saint-Aignan , managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co , said . Instead , he argues , banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default . " The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected , " said a director at one U.K. merchant bank . " What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now ," he added .( Adds title first paragraph ) . Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement , such as those based in Japan , will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers . Indeed , regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements . Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger , following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed , said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules . Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting , that is , offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other . The paper said that regulatory authorities " recognize that such arrangements ( netting ) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk . " Furthermore , the paper said , if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests , it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly . But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design . "One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market . So we do n't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court , " said one bank official . Reuter

Wheat buying , however , is a different story , Melnikov said . " If the United States is interested in selling its wheat , then they must offer competitive prices , and it 's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered , " he said .

Bureau , the nation 's largest farm organization , voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations . " We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill , " said Dean Kleckner , president . " The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation . " Several independent studies indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced , " Kleckner said . The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market . A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate . The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather . Reuter

protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community ( EEC ) and threaten the global trading system . Paul Channon , secretary for trade and industry , said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports , which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers , " the community would have to retaliate . " His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo , who said if the bill passed , the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports . Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress . De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks . Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit , which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs . Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods . Channon said Japan 's trade surplus is causing everyone problems its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations , 16.7 billion dlrs . " The more united pressure there could be , the better , " he said . Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes . He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards . " But if both sides drew back from the brink that time ," he said , " " it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion . " Channon added that " There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines . " He said other potential conflicts are already in sight alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils and " the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations bett er . " He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation 's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT ( General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade ) as an arbiter of trade practices . He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States , adding " if the ( trade ) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT , what is to happen to the rest of us ?

The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business , make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds . Under the plan , which was presented to institutional lenders , the company 's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp , "substantial amounts " of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company . Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common . The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a " resulting dilution of the existing common stock , " Allis-Chalmers said in a statement . Under the plan , holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock . Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common . Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy . The restructuring must be approved by creditors , common and preferred holders ,and present and former employees . Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing " appears to represent the company 's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached . " The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring . " It is too early to talk about a charge " because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions , he said . Also under the plan , payments to Allis-Chalmers ' private lenders would be deferred . Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met . Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made " at substantially reduced levels . " Allis-Chalmers , once one of the leading farm equipment companies , sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs , leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks , air conditioning , fluids handling and solid materials processing . Last year , Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus , Ohio . Under the restructuring plan , Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses . Solid materials processing , which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction , accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers 's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs . The company will also sell its fluids handling operations , which makes pumps and valves . That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company 's 1985 revenues .

He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC 's first joint production venture , to build two hulls for <O nomichi Dockyard Co Ltd> , was a success . Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms , including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMA.T> , he said . Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TE U ( twenty foot equivalent unit ) container ships this year to Onomichi , which would complete production . " We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future , " Lo said . He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing . This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea . Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975 . Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs , with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs . But he said the company , which is Taiwan 's largest shipbuilder , still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery . " We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification , " he said . Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year . He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87 .

yen 's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies , thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions , Japanese and European research officials said . The officials , looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five ( G-5 ) industrial nations , told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture , which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances . Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan European Community ( EC ) axis , to the discomfort of Europe . In many ways , not least in terms of rare international cooperation , the September , 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one . But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture , in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance , but not necessarily central significance , the officials said . The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place , the dollar was already on its way down . The agreement simply helped it on its way . Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely . " You have to look at the dollar 's peak compared with now , and that was well before Plaza , " he said . On February 25 , 1985 , the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen . On September 20 , the Friday before Plaza , it was 242 . Since then , despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action , the dollar trend has been down , down , down . Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen . The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story . The European currencies are moving back up against the yen . The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which , but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing . In 1986 , Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms , five pct in yen . This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus . Last January , Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years . Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms , but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms . " The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe , where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms , which is what is important to them . Suddenly , instead of the U.S. , It is Europe that is laying the golden egg , " said de Hora . The EC is worried . EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales , but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base , compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade . The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms , a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance , and which will cause problems . " This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries . But therefore , Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge , " said Azusa Hayashi , Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry . " If you want my objective view , I do n't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance . Last year , we asked for moderation in exports , and this year we may have to do so again ," he said .

They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland 's economy , and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory . " Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving . They did have a bad effect , yes , but they only contributed to largely internal , economic problems , " one said . The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation ( MFN ) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law . The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National E c on omy , an offshoot of the central planning commission . According to one Western envoy , an expert on Polish economic affairs , it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States , as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders . But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely , he said , dismissing the estimate as " a theoretical projection based on a high point , which has no real scientific evaluation . " A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed . Imports have suffered , slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln , as credits ran out . Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West . Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion , official figures show . Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets including agricultural equipment , textiles , chemicals and some foodstuffs Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons . " Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons , " said one expert . " It 's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western econom y . " " There 's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it , " another said , adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today 's reality . Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as " nebulous , " one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges . Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland , which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry . " MFN does n't really mean anything , only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries . It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now ," said one Western envoy . He said Polish products were not competitive , and their quality was too low . Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S. , Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland 's efforts to regain entry . Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently . Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently , " Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult , and in certain cases impossibl e In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs . " While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation , it says it has a " moral right " to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally . But a Western economist said " The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy wo n't cut any ice . The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarit y . " Nevertheless , Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka , in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank , made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States . He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States , " but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners . " He stressed that the U.S. " had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland 's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt . " Putting it more sharply , one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank , IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role . "As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations , " he said , citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate .

2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter , official statistics show . Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln . For 1986 as a whole , visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg , sharply up from 1985 's 2.2 . Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984 . Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion . The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday . The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion . In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg . The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln , the CSO said . However , 1986 's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985 , while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion . The figures were broadly in line with market expectations . The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions , particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available . REUTER

money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week . This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall , dealers said . The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22 , which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence . The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23 , the day after the Paris accord , and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3 , where it has now stabilised . Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct . While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point , the Bank of France 's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2 , when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide . The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5 . The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates , while using the intervention rate to set the floor . Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut , and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday , although an earlier cut could not be excluded . A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning , banking sources said . They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France , discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut . But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target , giving scope for a small fall in rates . M-3 money supply , the government 's key aggregate , finished 1986 within the government 's three to five pct growth target , rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985 . REUTER

days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd , down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December , a Reuter survey shows . The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders , industry executives and analysts in Europe , the Middle East , Africa , Latin America and Asia . They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system , which came into effect last month . OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling , largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait , the figures show . The UA E , together with the much smaller producer Ecuador , was also producing above quota in the first days of March , the survey reveals . But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output , together with Iran "s inability to export as much as its quota allows . Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March , the figures showed . Saudi output excluding movements into stocks fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February , against a 4.133 mln bpd quota . The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production . Kuwait , which has consistently denied quota violations , was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output against its 948,000 bpd quota . Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria , both substantially under quota in February and early March . Qatar 's February output was 230,000 bpd , and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota . Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar "s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers . Nigeria 's early March output was about one mln bpd , down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd .

for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions , lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods , Shell chairman Peter Holmes said . The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year , while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg . The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously , with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume . Although the figures were lower , they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts . Shell Transport and Trading Plc <SC.L> shares , the U.K. Arm of the group , rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg . Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985 . Also , a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results , which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts , industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted . However , he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987 , due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986 . The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas , which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag , analysts said . Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all . Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period , with Shell Oil being one of them . The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader , Holmes added . Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity . " Exploration is currently pretty flat . We are going to go on , but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn , " he said . A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel . Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. I m ports . " If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything ," he noted . U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day ( bbd ) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel . This favored OPEC 's attempts to stabilise prices , as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down . " OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well ...Everything is moving in ( its ) direction , " he added . Reuter

decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks , saying it reflected the socialist government 's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity . The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13 , saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets . Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank , which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth . " I think it 's a good measure , " a senior foreign banker said . " It 's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the econom y . " " It shows that the political will is very strong . They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run , " he added . The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago , the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements , preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates . But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds was attracting money from abroad , strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive . The government says industry 's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation . At 8.3 pct last year , the rate was way above that of Spain 's major trading partners in the European Community , which it joined a year ago . To help meet this year 's target of five pct , it is insisting pay rises stay at that level , setting the stage for clashes with trade unions , who say they have made enough sacrifices . Demonstrations by workers , students and farmers , whose demands essentially involve more government spending , have become an almost daily occurrence . But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can . Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard . The Bank of Spain , which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct , left it unchanged at today 's auction . The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year , when it was below 12 pct . Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months . The measure will take effect tomorrow , following the publication of the decree in today 's official gazette . Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and , inevitably , push lending rates higher . A companion measure , reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas , also takes effect tomorrow . Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates . REUTER

the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas , the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying . The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result " of member countries ' firm determination to defend the organisation 's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel , and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price . " The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25 . The official gave no figure for February output . The statement said only that " the reduction in total supplies , namely actual exports of crude oil and products , plus local deliveries in member countries , is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month .

economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies . In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank , Ortner , the bank 's senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct . " I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen , " he said . On the other hand , Ortner said that he thought that " the yen is still a little bit undervalued , " and " could go up another 10 or 15 pct . " In addition , Ortner , who said he was speaking personally , said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was " fairly priced . " Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations . Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza A ccord , the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact . He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off . Turning to Brazil and Mexico , Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts . He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker 's debt initiative . Reuter

the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season , a Cargill , Inc. analyst said . Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin , David Rogers of Cargill 's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months , with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows . He said the wheat trade , because wheat can be produced in many nations , is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets . Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms , demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres .

money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut , leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high . It closed at its best level since September 12 , at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index , as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains , dealers said . Meanwhile , opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day , March 17 , and why it should want to . The Bank 's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon , when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage . " They 're really making the discount houses suffer , " said Stephen Lewis , economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew . " Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates . " This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges , talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday , so buyers came strongly into the pound . The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close , up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60 , and 2.8900/60 marks , up from 2.8720/50 . " If this pressure keeps up ...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget , " said Jeremy Hale , economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp. Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow . However , analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains . There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious , said Peter Fellner , U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co. Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election , and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds , Fellner said . An election could be delayed until mid-198 8 , but most forecasts say it will be this year . Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar . However , analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether . The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move , one way or the other , to half points here and there . Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market , notably from Japan . They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar , given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington . The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget , argued Lewis. " But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England , " he added . The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget , but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders . Meanwhile , analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front , today 's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg . This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985 . Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause , but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals . The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets . Privately , some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week , but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow . If a move comes before March 17 , forecasts are for a half-point cut , with another half or full point about Budget day . REUTER

Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made . " It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve 's promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth ," he told the Eastern Economic Association . Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts . " Federal Reserve monetary policy , the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation , the G-6 agreement , and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction , " he said . G-6 is comprised of U.S. , Britain , France , Japan , West Germany and Canada . On the budget deficit , Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending . There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop , he said . But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable . " This situation , however , cannot continue indefinitely . Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending , " he said . A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed , Johnson said . He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth . On the trade deficit , Johnson warned against " quick fix " solutions , which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation . " What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth ," he said . Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time . Reuter

Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder labour subsidy for Rotterdam 's strike-hit general cargo sector as from July 1 . Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy . The chairman of the port employers ' organization , SVZ , Jacques Schoufour , said he was unhappy with the decision and added there was now no alternative to proceeding with redundancy plans . The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19 in protest at employers ' plans to make 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year . Meanwhile , the port and transport union , FNV , attacked loss figures given for the port for this year . The figures , issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ , put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985 at 37 mln . Earlier , the employers had put the figure at around 30 mln . The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their plan to restructure completely the port 's general cargo sector . Reuter

Jorge Luis Leao Franco , a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union , told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage , which began last Friday . Brazil 's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct . The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels , including 50 in Brazil 's main port , Santos , and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro . A broad , six ships lay idle , in the Netherlands , Spain , Venezuela , France and South Africa , he said . Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government , which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil 's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country 's trade balance . The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority , Murilo Rubens Habbema , was quoted in today 's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports . " Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment , and it is not conceivable that exports be hit , " he said . " But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad , and all this through the fault of the seamen , " Rubens Habbema said .

deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation 's huge trade deficit , U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said . Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry , Yeutter said " Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now . " Unless we get the budget deficit down , we will not get the trade deficit down . " He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits . Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and , to a lesser extent , other U.S. securities as well . " We 'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 , but there 's still a long way to go , " Yeutter said . He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth , U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a " level playing fiel d " for trade . The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down . On the fiscal side , Yeutter said " the budget deficit is still our biggest problem " and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit . In the international area , he said that " our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth . " Commenting on Japan , which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States , Yeutter said " Japan is just not doing the job on the import side . " Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner . In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting , Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies , but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued . " The market will determine the dollar 's proper value in the end , " Yeutter said . However , he added that , if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit , " the dollar will be the equalizer . " Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers . He said " there 's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem . " Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners , Yeutter said . " There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation , " Yeutter said , adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems .

yen 's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies , thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions , Japanese and European research officials said . The officials , looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five ( G-5 ) industrial nations , told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture , which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances . Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan European Community ( EC ) axis , to the discomfort of Europe . In many ways , not least in terms of rare international cooperation , the September , 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one . But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture , in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance , but not necessarily central significance , the officials said . The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place , the dollar was already on its way down . The agreement simply helped it on its way . Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely . " You have to look at the dollar 's peak compared with now , and that was well before Plaza , " he said . On February 25 , 1985 , the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen . On September 20 , the Friday before Plaza , it was 242 . Since then , despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action , the dollar trend has been down , down , down . Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen . The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story . The European currencies are moving back up against the yen . The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which , but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing . In 1986 , Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms , five pct in yen . This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus . Last January , Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years . Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms , but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms . " The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe , where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms , which is what is important to them . Suddenly , instead of the U.S. , It is Europe that is laying the golden egg , " said de Hora . The EC is worried . EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales , but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base , compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade . The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms , a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance , and which will cause problems . " This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries . But therefore , Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge , " said Azusa Hayashi , Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry . " If you want my objective view , I do n't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance . Last year , we asked for moderation in exports , and this year we may have to do so again ," he said .

protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington 's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade . Robert Arnott , Australia 's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver . " Australia today said the United States ' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture , " the Australian delegation said in a statement . " The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture , " Arnott told the meeting . Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for " dubious protective measures " by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports . He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs . This covered imports of dairy products , pea nuts , cotton and sugar . Asked to comment , Michael Samuels , U.S. ambassador to the GATT , told Reuters " These charges have been made since the very beginning . The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy , part of our law when we joined the GATT " . " We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs . We can negotiate them all ," Samuels added . Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September . Bargaining in agricultural goods and services ( ba nking , tourism , insurance ) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods . Reuter

later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/ 92 , or " de-coupling , " provision to cover feedgrains , and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited , Congressional sources said . The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop . The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments . The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year . It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee , the sources said . Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs . Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill , committee staffers said . The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting , and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week . Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program , since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30 . Farmers are now making their planting decisions , so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented , an Agriculture Department source said . An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week 's subcommittee hearing on the bill , with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman , D-Kan. , saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary . Major commodity groups , including the National Corn Growers , the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen 's Association , have voiced strong opposition to 0/92 . But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers , so it should be extended to other crops . There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat , said Gene Moos , aide to house majority leader Tom Foley , D-W ash . Projected cost savings , in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures , would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application , Moos said . Rep. Charles Stenholm , D-Tex. , may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat , with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill . " Stenholm 's bill is not a rejection of 0/ 92 , only of the timing , " a congressional staff member said . Rep. Arland Stangeland ( R-Minn . ) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains . Reuter

said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December , partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices . Lu kman , during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica , told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February , Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel . " We are determined to stand firm by the ( December ) accord , " he said . " I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work ," he said . Lukman gave no specific figures for February output . He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures . Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd , he said " That could well be correct . " Opec "s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was " well below " its ceiling in February . But it gave no figures . But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd . The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd . Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1 . Lukman said Qatar , Nigeria , Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas . Iraq , which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact , had produced less than had been anticipated , he said . Lukman said that some industry reports " may be correct " that in February , Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota , Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota . He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States " West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude . However , he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks . " We have to be patient for two or three weeks . The market is now firming on actual fundamental s , " he said , adding that he expected it to go " up and up " even beyond official prices after early April . This is when , traditionally , there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria "s . The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait , Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products . Also , some of Venezuela "s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system , he said . Lukman said that if refiner -buyers , now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices , instead used their own stocks and ran them down to " dangerous levels , " they would eventually have to buy Opec oil . " When they realise it is not a free-for-all ( in the market ) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on , " he said . Lu kman , asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms , said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable , flexible and under constant review , not only when the market seemed weak . He said that so far , no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting , now twice-postponed , was not a high priority for Opec at the moment . " At this time , we have to get our priorities right , " he said . " The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working , not dealing with a differential of cents between grades . " But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system , a meeting would be called , he said . Reuter

large inflows of capital into Canada , principally into the country 's bond market , is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar .

government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance . Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production . " It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade ...(if not ) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe , the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful , " U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said . Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting , which ends tomorrow , demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment . The need for urgent reforms is justified by the " imbalance and tensions of the world economy ," the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said . And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , he noted . Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas . Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices , allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand , and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids , proposed James Howard , Executive Vice-president of Cargill ( USA ) , one of the world 's largest cereal houses . Franz-Josef Feiter , agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices . However , " differentiated policy treatment is required " to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC , he said . " Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community , " he said . Reuter

committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat , but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later , Congressional sources said . The sources said key lawmakers including Reps . Glenn English ( D-Okla. ) , and Dan Glickman ( D-Kan . ) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm ( D-Tex . ) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat . This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only . That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat . Under 0/ 92 , a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments . Earlier today , the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92 . The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/ 92 , and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill . Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92 . " The timing ( of the proposal ) is off , " said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member . However , several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package . Gene Moos , aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley ( D-Wash. ) , predicted agriculture 's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs . A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings . A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years . Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season , Congressional sources said . Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains . If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened , sources said . Reuter

suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 . The developing world 's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans , and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets , economists said . " That sounds like a reasonable strategy . But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ," Aldo Roldan , Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics , said . Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets , but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable . " Domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates , " Roldan said . The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil , where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs . But he added " They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels . " Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee , and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world 's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance . Negotiations between International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence . " Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations , which others wanted changed , " one senior coffee dealer said . The dealer , who declined to be named , said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share . At the end of the talks , he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer . Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales , the dealer said . " If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar , ninety or eighty cents , " he said . New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb , while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit . President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute , Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas . Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts . " They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been , " according to Richard Loewy , analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem , a good crop , plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop . " Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they ca n't afford to store the crops , " he said . The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields . " We are going to see a very rapid decline , earlier than usual , this year in our ( U.S. ) exports , " Loewy said . Tommy Eshleman , economist for the American Soybean Association ( ASA ) , said this year 's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes , versus 13.7 mln last year . Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather . Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate , offered to farmers who give crops as collateral , Eshleman said . He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate , which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market . Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan . " We 're getting into a period when they ( Brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export , " Eshleman said . But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently . Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation . He said the debt situation was a major consideration . " The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storag e , " he added . Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops , Melicias said it would not make a big difference . On other commodity markets , Brazil 's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital . Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest , which could limit exports to the world market , analysts said . The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments , and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar , will give it little room to stretch exports , they said . Brazil 's other major crop , cocoa , is in its third year of surplus . " Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell , so I do n't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it , " one analyst said . " If they come out as aggressive sellers , the market would collapse and they ca n't afford to do that , " she added . Reuter

picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report , economists said . U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February , twice what the financial markets expected . This follows a 319,000 gain in January , revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase . " Even if you look at January and February together , this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market ," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation . Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast . The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January . The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours , the longest factory work week since November 1966 , the Commerce Department said . " The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct , " said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank . This compares to a 0.4 pct gain in January U.S. industrial production . Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January . " Combined with the increase in hours worked , this means we 'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement , " he said . Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January . He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm 's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct . Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve 's monetary policy . But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either . " This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing , " said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. " It gives them more room to address the dollar situation ," he said . " If they had to nudge policy tighter , they could do so , but it 's most likely they 'll sit and wait . " " The data have not been uniform , " Stone added . " Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong . " In January , U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct , followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders . U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct , and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs . " Things just are n't adding up ," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. " Consumer spending , capital spending , goverment spending , and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct , " he said . " The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up , but that 's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth . " Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January . Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work . Even so , some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook . Jason Benderly of Goldman , Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct , and that it continues to improve in the first quarter . " Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter , but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products , chemicals , high-tech goods , and capital goods show that trade is improving , " Benderley said . " The economy is moving between extremes , " he said . " Some reports are going to look bad and some good , but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct . " A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February 's employment gain . Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February , compared to a gain of 117,000 in January , previously reported at 166,000 . Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February . But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January , revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain . The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct . This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months , the lowest reading since March 1980 , the Commerce Department noted . " The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report , " Carson said . " This takes away the Fed 's flexibility to ease , but there 's no reason to tigh ten . It 's way too early for that .

Ecuador "s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day ( bp d ) . A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping station at El Salado on Ecuador 's main pipeline was damaged . He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed . The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador volcano , near the epicentre of the quake , which Ecuadorean seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale . The Aguarico bridge was also close to the volcano , he said . The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia , according to Ecuadorean officials . No injuries were reported . REUTER

signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled , market operators said . The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market , possibly at the beginning of next week , by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate , which has stood at eight pct since January 2 , or in its seven-day repurchase rate , set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5 . The central bank 's averaged-out day to day call money rate , the reference rate for interbank money market operators , which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week , dealers noted . The Bank of France 's " open market " policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates . For the moment the sentiment is of " wait and see " on rate cuts , but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators , a dealer for a major French bank said . Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market , noting that this week 's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed . The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion , one banker said . Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange . There has been a flood of large bond issues , but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-r ates which have been snapped up , and with generally broadly negative fees . Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales ( CAECL ) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9 , which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct . Even classic fixed-rate issues , after being neglected since the end of last year , are finding buyers , one banker said . Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set , with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues . These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France , to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier , a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France , and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire .

introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year , has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988 . The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy , a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet . The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy , with a particular emphasis on long-term rates . The team 's report to the government praises last year 's spending cuts , which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs , and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform " better , on a broader basis , than at any time so far in the 1980s . " However , it adds that with lower inflation , stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989 . The government 's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986 . The report says " The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government . " It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible . " B ecause of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience ( for ) tax reductions , we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988 , " the report adds . The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government 's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation . It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows , which increased strongly in 1986 . It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs .

strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in holding bank base rates at 11 pct . But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's policy , stated at the end of the Paris Group of Six meeting last month , that he wanted to see sterling broadly stable about then prevailing levels , market sources said . Since then , the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index , up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day . Today 's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19 . A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling . The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting . Paul Temperton , chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd , estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct . " Even after this action over the last few weeks , sterling 's only just within striking distance of that rang e , " he said . Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area . However , they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term , despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports . " If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are , what 's to stop it ( g oing higher ) ," said John Cox , executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd , a major operator on the London foreign exchange market . Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days , despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention , and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs . The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23 , the day after the Paris meeting . But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels . He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat . " If rates do n't come down , the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling , " he said . Most dealers agree there is a good deal of " hot money " being invested in sterling , money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates , which could flow out at equally short notice . However , the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment . " The last thing they want to do is reduce them ( rates ) and have to jack them back up again ," said Richard Jeffrey , economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd. He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling , at least in the near term . However , most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17 , Budget Day . The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget , said Temperton . The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election , the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets . " Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget . He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut , " said Ian Harwood , economist at Warburg Securities , the equities arm of Mercury International Group . Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today . There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind . This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday , and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct , early last October . However , with this Bill rate pertaining to three-mont hs money , banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank 's intentions on short term rates . REUTER

dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall . " OPEC is keeping its production down , and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers , " said Daniel McKinley , oil analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co. " That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher , " he added . The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today , a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week . The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel . " O il traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota , but now both of those assumptions have come under question , " McKinley said . Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area , or in industrialized nations , were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year . IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes , or about 74 days consumption . Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking . Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike , which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price . " This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon . I would imagine by about the middle of the month ( March ) ," the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview . For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output , traders said . A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week . Also , an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments . " This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues , the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there , " McKinley said . International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes , such as North Sea Brent , were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week . If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries , trading managers at several companies told Reuters . But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues . Stephen Hanke , chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management , said OPEC production was lower " because of the Saudi cut ( to 3.1 mln bpd ) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas . " He added , " The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota , and the drain on the Saudis will continue , forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price , " he added . There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices , traders said . Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent , which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs , far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light . Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price . " There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals , which are below official prices and this is probably being resold , " one international trader said . Reuter

will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ) approves the contract as expected next week . Pat Henderson , spokesperson for the MG E , said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC 's Tuesday meeting . It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December , 1985 . The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup , the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process . The syrup , commonly called HFCS- 55 , is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages . Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange . The contract , designated by the symbol " HF, " would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST . Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March , May , July , September and December . Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight , with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT . " We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved , those producers being the large processors , the corn wet millers , and the users being the beverage bottlers , " Henderson said . " But there are potentials for all types of people to use it . There is quite a list of industries that utilize fructose . " Reuter

seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis . A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships . On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance . Today the government faced a fresh problem , when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo , the country 's industrial heartland , and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices . There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage . The seamen 's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras . The Jornal do Brasil newspaper , in an editorial today entitled " Dangerous Confrontation , " said " From the economic point of view the seamen 's strike carries an alarming cost , with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country 's external trade . " The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct . Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen 's strike is legal . But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union , Jorge Luis Leao Franco , told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal 's ruling . Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government 's Cruzado Plan price freeze . Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month . Not only workers but also businessmen are restive . Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo , Parana , Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul . Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions . Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados ( six U.S. Cents ) a litre from 0.56 cruzados ( about 2.5 cents ) . Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could .

feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat , congressional sources said . The disaster aid bill , introduced by Rep. Glenn English ( D-Okla. ) , sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat . An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat , but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers . Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat , it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally , they said . If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat , then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week , sources said . English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm ( R-Tex ) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only , but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear . Agricultural aides to English said the congressman 's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers . However , if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat , then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill , they said . Under a 0/92 plan , farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments . Rep. Arlan Stangeland ( R-Minn . ) and Harold Volkmer ( D-Mo. ) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains . An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill , but to be fair to all crops . Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land , economists said . Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program .

U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow , said Mike Hall , lobbyist for the association . " The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed " in their complaint , Hall told Reuters . A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel . " This was cleary a political decision , " Hall said . " The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant . " The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices , thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program , Hall said . Hall said this is a new definition for injury , but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs . The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed , Hall said . The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community , saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain . Reuter

expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook , financial analysts said . The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday , they noted . " I do n't like that fact that we had a close below 101 , " said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner . The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range , which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists . But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday . Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses . " I tend to go along with the double top scenario , " said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico . Rico noted that the possible formation , along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume , were negative signals . Despite what could be a negative chart outlook , Leiner remains cautiously optimistic , and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week . The optimistic outlook , as well as Leiner 's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term , is based on an improving inflation outlook . With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy , " the inflation outlook is improving , " Leiner said , and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices . Still , Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook . Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices , and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday . " The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon , " said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer . The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely " media induced , " Singer said . He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas , " oil stocks are at tremendously high levels . " Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay , oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February , he said , and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices . Reuter

" We have heard nothing about this , but if Brazil has decided not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one of our main customers , " Agriculture , Livestock and Fisheries Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said . Private sources also said Argentina 's exports would not be affected by Brazil 's decision , which Agriculture Minister Iris Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo . Brazil had not asked for any Argentine maize , they said . They also said a smaller crop and adverse weather this summer in Argentina had reduced production . Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any from Argentina .

measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake . Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct . A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports , declaring force majeure . Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador 's main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast . The quake on Thursday , which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale , killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km ( 50 miles ) east of Quito . Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day . The government 's austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines . Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays , an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said . REUTER

a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could rank among this centuries ' worst peacetime shipping tragedies . Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian coast last night . If confirmed , the toll would make the incident the world 's worst since a Soviet liner , the Admiral Nakhimov , collided with a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the loss of nearly 400 lives . A further 856 people were rescued . The world 's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives . The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914 when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada . The world 's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30 , 1945 . In 1985 , more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries sank near Dhaka , 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and 147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah . REUTER

under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life , experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship . Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover . Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors . But a spokesman for the owners , Townsend Thoresen , said it was also possible the ferry had been holed . Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise , but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present . "Our investigator is there already . We shall have to wait and see . But it is too early to say what happened , " he told BBC radio . As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued , maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called " RoRo " ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise . In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads . Townsend Thoresen say the ship , built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980 , was built to the highest safety standards . But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design . Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge . "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over . An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability , " he said . Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level . " If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship , " he added . REUTER

shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months , a senior Energy Ministry official said . The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline , which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast . It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline , the official , who did not want to be named , told Reuters . Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks . The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale . The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador , where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues . Financially pressed Ecuador , a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude , about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel , another Energy Ministry spokesman said . Last year , it exported an average of 173,500 bpd , according to the central bank . However , Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline , costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs , to hook up with a Colombian pipeline , the first official said . He estimated it could take about 60 days to build . Ecuador , squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986 , had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January , about equal to one month 's imports . It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks . The country 's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs , the eighth largest in Latin America . In Caracas , President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline . Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May , Lusinchi said . A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program , he said .

needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year , bond market sources say . " At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates . But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigner s , " one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said . The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs . Friday 's loan stock was the third this year already , the sources noted . It carried a 10-year maturity , a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue . This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct . But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors , and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon . Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size , with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May . One finance ministry economist said " It is n't more . It 's just the size ( of each bond ) which has increased . " He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt . Until recently , federal issues sold very strongly abroad , with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors . With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar , however , foreign investors have begun to back away from the market , as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish . Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing , having raised more than 18 billion marks . The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986 . But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion . The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form . Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently , other factors , including the government 's tax reduction program , would also reduce income next year . " The problem here will be the tax reform , " the portfolio manager said . He added that the government 's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings . The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other . The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year , it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term " Kassenobligation " notes . A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year . Though many sources agreed , they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect . " I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase , " the manager said . Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance , with the Bundesbank 's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier . But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack , as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark . " The demand was n't so good , " a dealer for a German bank in London said . The dollar 's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently , some dealers said . REUTER

One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price , the sources said . Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount , they said . Iran 's discounted sales have not , however , managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets , oil traders said . Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe , and reports that OPEC 's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day . Firmer gas oil on the London futures , and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels , they said .

Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade , face slower economic growth , and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) said . The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year , compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December . It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences , and Japan , hardest hit by currency appreciation this year . The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan . It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 , due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices . It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast , to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 . It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year . The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year , as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged . It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets , and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year 's 18.4 pct drop . The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 , it said . " This is not a crash scenario but the dollar 's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing , " the EIU said . " Talking will not stop the dollar 's slide for long and the February meeting ( of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada ) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan , or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy , " it said . It said the key to the dollar 's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss . " Th us far they have been willing , " the EIC said , adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse . To contain such a currency crisis , dollar interest rates would have to soar , bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis , it said . On trade , the EIU said prospects for 1987 look " increasingly sick . " Import growth , forecast in December at 4.5 pct , is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988 , it said . The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor , with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December , the EIU said . On the export side , it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe , while Japan 's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower , more competitively-priced dollar . It said in most of Europe and in Japan , raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 . Reuter

told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move , banking sources said . The sources were reporting Poehl 's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag . Press representatives were not invited . The sources , speaking separately , said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany . " It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates , " said one banker who attended the symposium . A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks , made at the private meeting . But , according to a second source , who also declined to be identified , Poehl 's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark . " He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them . He said that quite clearly , " the second source said . In reply to questions , Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance , the sources said . Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded , by cuts in German rates , to come to the bargaining table as early as last September , one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying , " No , they would n't have been . We checked that . " The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates . Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting , saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar , the sources said . For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies , including the U.S. , Poehl had said . The sources said the tone of Poehl 's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation . One source said Poehl 's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany 's economic growth . Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation . This led , for instance , to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January . The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation . The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs . Latest data for central bank money stock , the Bundesbank 's main measure of money supply , showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January , outside its three to six pct 1987 target . Share prices rose in very active trading today , with dealers reporting that Poehl 's remarks , coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium , brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels .

Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out " appropriate and timely " action if necessary . Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc . The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity . Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany 's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987 . But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary . He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected , while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year .

shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months , a senior Energy Ministry official said . The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline , which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast . It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline , the official , who did not want to be named , told Reuters . Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks . The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale . The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador , where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues . Financially pressed Ecuador , a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) , was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude , about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel , another Energy Ministry spokesman said . Last year , it exported an average of 173,500 bpd , according to the central bank . However , Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline , costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs , to hook up with a Colombian pipeline , the first official said . He estimated it could take about 60 days to build . Ecuador , squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986 , had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January , about equal to one month 's imports . It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks . The country 's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs , the eighth largest in Latin America . In Caracas , President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline . Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May , Lusinchi said . A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program , he said .

Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) , hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade , face slower economic growth , and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) said . The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year , compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December . It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences , and Japan , hardest hit by currency appreciation this year . The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan . It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 , due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices . It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast , to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 . It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year . The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year , as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged . It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets , and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year 's 18.4 pct drop . The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 , it said . " This is not a crash scenario but the dollar 's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing , " the EIU said . " Talking will not stop the dollar 's slide for long and the February meeting ( of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada ) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan , or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy , " it said . It said the key to the dollar 's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss . " Th us far they have been willing , " the EIC said , adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse . To contain such a currency crisis , dollar interest rates would have to soar , bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis , it said . On trade , the EIU said prospects for 1987 look " increasingly sick . " Import growth , forecast in December at 4.5 pct , is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988 , it said . The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor , with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December , the EIU said . On the export side , it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe , while Japan 's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower , more competitively-priced dollar . It said in most of Europe and in Japan , raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 . However , rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct . Non -oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984 , the EIU said . After a rise of 18 pct in 1986 , the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988 , it said . It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986 . Reuter

States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substan tially , according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics . The study , by Paul Wonnacott , said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada 's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export 's by about seven pct . He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies , end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . The United States and Canada the world 's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year opened free trade talks last June . They are aiming for a pact by next October . Wonnacott , an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland , said an agreement should include Elimination of tariffs between the two countries , phased in over a five to 10-year period Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries , replacing current " Buy America " and " Buy Canada " provisions with a " Buy North America " provision Fewer restrictions in trade in services , chiefly finance and transportation A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes . Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem , the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties . The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct . He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage . Wonnacott said " bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers . He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production . Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately , he said , because of the already large U.S. gross national product . Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations .

onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997 , payable 40 stg pct on application . The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11 , with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5 . The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas . The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 " B . " A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissio ners . The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank 's announcement , with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news . Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling 's strength . The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct . The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because , dealers said , the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17 , thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's package of measures . However , in the face of sterling 's apparently inexorable climb , the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut . Today 's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling . Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget , although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage . Dealers noted that as part of the authorities ' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates , the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market . To the surprise of most participants , the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains . Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week 's . However , they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut , it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4 , well ahead of Friday 's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

state-owned oil company , said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland . Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988 , the company said . Depending on time required for regulatory approvals , construction could begin in 1989 , with first oil production as early as 1991 , Petro-Canada said . " We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the ( Terra Nova ) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil , or more than 70 mln barrels , and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system , " Petro-Canada said . The Terra-Nova field , lying 350 kilometers east of St. John 's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field , was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984 . " We 've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field , and we hope this summer 's drilling will prove up additional reserves there , " the company said . Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments , Petro-Canada said . Petro-Canada , which will act as operator of the two wells , has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field 's East Flank block , a company spokesman said later . Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd , Mobil Oil Canada Ltd , Gulf Canada Resources Inc , ICG Resources Ltd , Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX . Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field 's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil , company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada 's Calgary office . Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field 's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels , he added . Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991 , and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field , he said . Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production , with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd , company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query . The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production , he said . Reuter

was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure , dealers said . During its routine intervention in the market , the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct . The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17 . For some time , fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down . Although political considerations the government 's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank 's delaying action , worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market 's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank 's caution , dealers said . In the event , sterling continued firm after the rate cut , leaving the market still looking for another half point fall . Consequently , rates in the money market eased during the day , one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/1 6 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-mont hs trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct . Sterling cd 's were similarly down between 5/1 6 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year . Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct , almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week .

borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end , World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said . He told a news conference that rates in the U.S. , Japan , West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows . " The weight of opinion is ( that in a year from now ) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates , " he said . The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates . The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when , where and how much to borrow , Rotberg said . Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years ' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years . Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market , it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation , Rotberg said . Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding , only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency . Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers . Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case , it would not adopt new instruments . The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before , Rotberg said . However , for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants . The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959 , he said .

stg of insurance claims following the Zeebrugge ferry disaster , a spokesman for Lloyds of London said . It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers , crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much , if any , of the ship could be salvaged , said David Larner of Lloyds . The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen 's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L> . The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies , Larner said . Passengers , crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association , one of several shipowners ' mutual insurance funds worldwide . These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies . Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg , given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death . Shipping sources said , however , that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved . Larner said estimates of compensation claims " were pure guess work " at this time . But if the ship could not be salvaged , the claims would total at least 30 mln stg . Shares of insurances on the London stock exchange fell across the board in a generally weak market .

" We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only four , worth eight mln dlrs , " the spokesman said without specifying the amount paid out . The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28 . It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to approved private sector bidders , but would not be used to determine the kwacha 's exchange rate . Last week , he said the auction had run into trouble because of a shortage of foreign exchange .

Last year , Dart Group , owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books , competed against Kohlberg , Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc . The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company . The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs , according to analysts . Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment . Jerry Ballan , analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co , said , " They <Dart > has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well , such as Stop and Shop . " " My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out , " said Ballan . Analysts , however , said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations , which might make it difficult to thwart a bid . Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis . For the first quarter , Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago , and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987 . " But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily , due to Purity Supreme in New England , " Comeau said . He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations . Rickels , a home center business , has faced problems due to the state of that industry , and has reported lower returns as an operating unit , according to analysts . Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company 's operations .

for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit , which last year reached 170 billion dlrs . In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit , Roderick said , " There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies , as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us , must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery . " Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the " economic pain " our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar . But , he added , "As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners , it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable , lengthy and steep world recession . " Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations . At the end of 1986 , he said , the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs , compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion . A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX . The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 , although other factors were involved , Roderick said . But it is wrong , he said , " to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product qualit y . " These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem , Roderick said . He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets . In the speech , the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators . Among his proposals , which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week , were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company . Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made . Further , raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company 's stock , he said . And payment of greenmail , or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider 's stake , should be prohibited under the revised laws . Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage " fair price to all " takeovers . Reuter

today , making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month , as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria . The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks ' base lending rates earlier today , but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments . " S terling , in any shape or form , is flavor of the month and we 're set to see many more eurosterling deals , " one dealer said . Today 's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year , 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct , lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. " We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already , " one eurosterling specialist said . " Optically , psychologically , these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower . Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money ," he added . This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently , ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today , continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations . Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields . A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest . This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Store house , British designer Terence Conran 's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare , British Home Stores and Habitat .

Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October .

However , the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs , doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs .

agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation . A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed , including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange . "One of ( CBT Chairman ) Karsten Mahlmann 's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room , " the spokesman said . Another CBT official , executive vice president George Sladoje , said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor . A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room , Sladoje said . " We 've looked at five or six different alternatives , involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms , " he added . It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans , we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets , Sladoje said . " If we move out of one floor entirely , then the construction period will be about a year , " he said , adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year . The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest . In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits , exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area . This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures , Treasury Notes , Muni-bonds , and options on T-Bonds and T- Notes through an adjoining corridor , while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn , wheat , soybeans , soybean products and agricultural options . Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members . One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating . " There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area , " he said . The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants , one quarter at a time . " The first step , after deciding the most effective way to proceed , would be to get architectural and engineering drawings , " he said . He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves . " This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year , " he said . Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange , which merged with the CBT about a year ago , said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month . Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures , which now share their trading area . The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains , livestock , metals , financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts . " Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded , " one MidAm trader said . Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August .

three mln tonnes in 1986/87 Soviet grain imports is unlikely to affect the market Tuesday . They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports , partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U.S. corn , and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program .

Peruvian economy has said the government 's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure . The report , published today by the economic monthly , The Peru Report , said the success of president Alan Garcia 's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct " represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long . " Government officials had no immediate comment on the report , which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru 's export potential . The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct , its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties . " An early renewal of inflationary pressures , linked to monetary expansion , exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls , appears not improbable , " it added . The world bank report said the government 's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions , overvaluation of the currency , balance of payments disequilibrium , reserve losses , and sharply diminished creditworthiness . It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit , " the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments . " It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru 's export potential , external links and overall economic efficiency . The government 's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors , among its main traditional exports , suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability , it added .

foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January , the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report . The Fed 's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28 . This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury . The Fed 's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan 's State of the Union message and was " in a manner consistent with the joint statement " made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations . At that meeting , the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues . The Fed 's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred . But on January 28 , the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session . It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day . The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28 . It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks . The Fed noted that , after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December , the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January . It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling . It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar . During the final days of January , pressure on the dollar subsided . Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters , the Fed said . Moreover , doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates . The dollar 's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease . Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen . According to the Fed 's trade-weighted index , it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period . The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November . The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7 , 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen . The Fed 's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar . Reuter

its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year , an Agriculture Department official said . " They have always honoured the agreement , and there 's no reason now to think they wo n't this year , " he told Reuters . " They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community , from Canada , from the U.S. They 're active buyers from all sources at this point , " the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes . This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years . A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina , concern over Soviet winter crops , and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow 's recent interest . Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan , and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation , the official said . " The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists " and buy corn before prices get too high , the official said . "As soon as they need corn , they 'll buy it , " he added . USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union , but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes . The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again . " There has definitely been an evolving mind set from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now ," the official said . However , the situation in wheat is " a different story , " he said . Greater world supplies of wheat , heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely , he said . Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets , but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation . Reuter

Currently , some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S. , down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986 . Prices are now around 18 dlrs .

cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday . A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship 's hold have been recovered , but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution . A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out . Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on , roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour . The ferry 's owner is <European Ferries Plc> , majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc <PORL.L> . The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies . Experts said it could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies estimated to be trapped amid debris . " The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect one working day out of four , " said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam . He estimated the job itself would require 35 working days . Using reinforced cables , salvage experts intend to raise the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside . Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of the ferry , one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel routes from England to continental Europe . Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry 's main vehicle loading doors , set close to water level . In London , Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in through the bow doors . He said a major government inquiry into the disaster will be held , all similar ferries sailing from Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed . Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship 's doors , its ballast system and crew procedures , he added .

strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan 's market to foreign chips , industry analysts said . But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) , which is pressuring the firms , can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space , they said . U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact , the analysts said . " MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done , " said Bache Securities ( Japan ) associate vice president Peter Wolffe . Last month , MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact 's price controls . The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters , in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan , market analysts said . U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan . But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts , several analysts said . Last week , NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI 's request . " NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI 's demands , " said David Keller , analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once NEC cuts production , it means they all have . " Still , pressures remain to keep production high . Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact . " The best way to lower cost is to produce more , " said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec . Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter , Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said . Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions , some industry officials said . " It 's like tax avoidance schemes , " said Steve Donovan , head of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route , another opens . " MITI 's pressure has annoyed some makers , who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance . " It 's getting to be like communism , " said one . But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss . " They 're going to have to start running their businesses like businesse s , " Bache 's Wolffe said . MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips , but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best . " There has been some change , but it 's not across the board , " said one U.S. Spokesman . " The companies have a varying degree of urgency . " The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt , analysts added . Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM ( dynamic random access memory ) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips , where Japan now leads , analysts said . Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips , or interested in doing so , also remains unclear , they said . Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing . Even in the thorny area of access , much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness , some said . " The SIA ( U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association ) does n't even have an office here , " a source close to the industry said . " You could question just how committed they are . " In addition , some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea .

His plea , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Vis news , came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month . King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December .

" Non -OPEC countries " must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyon e , " he said . Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices , King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues . Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark . In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure , due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members . King Fahd said Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest oil exporter , was adhering to decisions made at OPEC 's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987 . A major non-OPEC producer , Britain has so far resisted the group 's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output .

interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago , bankers said . March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks ' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31 . This year the situation has been made worse by December 's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls . Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah . " A lot of small money has come back in , but the big money is holding out until after Apri l , " one U.S. Banker said . The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia , the central bank , is helping to keep rates high . Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year , with no prospect they will be lowered soon , the bankers said . Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88 , but added the " speculators " who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems . Indonesia holds general elections on April 23 , the first in five years , and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then .

to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar , a government spokesman said . The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae 's stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government 's determination to stand firm . Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce " Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are , I believe , extremely ill-advised . " Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen " The government 's policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position . " Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won 's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986 .

But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached " a crisis level .

" We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts , " the spokesman said . " The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports .+ The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run " a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country , like many other developing countries , which is reneging on its international obligations . " The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency , ruling out a major revaluation . So far this year , the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986 . He said South Korea was selecting " many " of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given . Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items , including sensitive agricultural products and large cars , effective from July . South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year , due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs , against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985 . It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year . But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency . REUTER

3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week 's securities repurchase agreement , dealers said . But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week . A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers , payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System ( EMS ) are likely to significantly burden the system . Banks built up minimum reserves today , ahead of the expected outflow . The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks , but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured . Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks . The Bundesbank declined to comment , but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over , the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed . Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks , but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week . Banks ' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday , averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March . Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks , the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March . No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week , but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tigh ten . " The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct , " one dealer said . REUTER

reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth . In a statement issued late last night , the central bank said convertible peseta accounts , funds which are not subject to exchange controls , would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday . Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements . The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct , also with effect on Friday . Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now around eight pct for overnight funds have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government 's monetary targets . They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain 's principal measure of money supply , the broad-based liquid assets in public hands ( ALP ) , to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February , compared with January 's 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986 . The target for 1987 is eight pct . The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market . Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday 's hike in reserve requirements , expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system . The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday 's 13.46 pct average for deposits . Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response " given that the market is short of funds . " But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank 's attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive .

said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit . " The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy , " he told a press conference . His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days . At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris , Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand , which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus . Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable . He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets .

yen , Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said . " A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden , " he told reporters . The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus . Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade . But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax . If the boycott is lifted tomorrow , Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government 's 1987/88 budget , Japanese officials said . Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm , unemotional manner . But , he added , " If the issue of rice is to be raised ...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people . " Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive . REUTER

commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy , a Reagan administration official said . The official 's comments also suggest that debtors ' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks , in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms . In addition , he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a " megabank , " where Third World debt would be pooled , and suggested the administration would support such a plan , even though it was not formally proposing it . At the same time , however , the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground . The Philippine proposal , together with Argentine suggestions that " exit bonds " be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy , would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan , the official said in an interview with Reuters . " All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered , " said the official , who asked not to be named . In October 1985 , Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations . In return , America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth . " The multilaterals have been performing well , the debtors have been performing well ," said the official . But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor , Brazil , was clearly an exception . The official , who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker , also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis . " We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively , " the official said . Among those ideas , the official said , were suggestions that commercial banks create a " megabank " which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called " exit bonds " for banks like regional American or European institutions . Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled , and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs . He emphasised that the " megabank " was not an administration plan but " something some people have suggested. " Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt . This plan , actively under consideration , would differ slightly from the one the official described . But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States . " If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go , fine . I do n't think they ever will . " He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution . Meanwhile , the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor . " The Philippine proposal is very interesting , it 's quite unique and I do n't think it 's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand , " the official said . Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes . These tradeable , dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity , the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor . Until now , bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low . The talks , now in their second week , are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt . The country , which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year , owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt . But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation , a development until now unacceptable to the banks . " It 's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before , " the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek . " Some people argue that ( cutting the spread ) is debt forgiveness What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money ," he added . He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines ' . Reuter

has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar , and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies , analysts said . The June pound , which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday , has spawned a new-found speculative boom . " Brokers have to push their clients somewhere ...and technically , the pound is in the best shap e , " PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said . " We 've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound , and we 're going to stay with that , there 's no reason to change , " Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said . Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions , although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday , Sloane said . The fundamental keys to the pound 's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy , analysts said . " Money seems to be chasing yields , " William B yers , of Bear Stearns , said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate . Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound , on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation 's budget is released March 17 . The budget itself could have an impact , depending on how well it is received , but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency . However , the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates , as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates , and extend the pound 's rally , Sloane said . The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound , but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon . The sideways price pattern in the June contract , with smaller and smaller price ranges , has formed a " bull flag " on price charts , technically-oriented analysts said . " It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout , " in this case to the upside , Sloane said . Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar . " At this stage of the game I 'd call the market long-term positive , but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above ( the previous contract high of ) 75.25 , " Byers said . As to the traditionally more active currencies , stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts . Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400 , respectively , closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430 . Yesterday 's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord , and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada . " We may still probe to see what the parameters are , " Byers said , " but people are very reluctant because they do n't know where the central banks will be ( to intervene ) . " Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy , but that he would be a buyer at that level . Reuter

bank advisory committee on a rescheduling of 181 mln dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989 , the Jamaican Information Service said .

The margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2 . The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year . Prime Minister Edward Seaga , who led the Jamaican delegation , called the terms very favourable to his country . The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee led by the Bank of Nova Scotia <BN O.TO> comes five days after Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations . That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) 's approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the compensatory financing facility .

Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country 's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt , bankers said . Gros will meet representatives of Citibank , the head of Brazil 's bank advisory committee , and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc . High on the agenda will be banks ' complaints about Brazil 's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines , the bankers said . Brazil 's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31 , 1987 , as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package . Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment , coupled with Brazil 's freeze , raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros . They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank . This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another . The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads , because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank . " It 's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community , " one banker said . Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil 's debt stance .

damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week "s earthquake , which will stop crude exports for five months , energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said . Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline , which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao , would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm .

verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices , oil industry analysts said . The analysts , who issued buy recommendations on some stocks , said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987 , after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half , and continue into the next decade . " P eople , however , cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying , " said Sandi Haber Sweeney , senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc. Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> , Halliburton Co <HAL> , Dresser Industries <DI> , Baker International <BKO> , and McDermott International Inc <MDR> , which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons , a Dallas-based investor . Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas , they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S. " Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster , " said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs . The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago , Huges Tool Co <HT> figures show . The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986 , according to Ike Kerridge , vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool . " The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988 , " Kerridge said . Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern , Kerridge said . " Halliburton is the best value , " said Jeffrey Freedman , vice president at Smith Barney , Harris and Upham Inc , adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value , is diversifed in non-oil field businesess , and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt . Schlumberger is Freedman 's second favorite oil service stock . " Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry , " Freedman said . " Schlumberger 's management shift , asset restructuring , including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor , and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity , " according to a report by George Gaspar , first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc. Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs . Bernstein 's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult . Her favorite is Baker International , which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co. Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company , Sweeney said . Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations , including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters , said Swarup . Reuter

fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day ( bpd ) to defend prices , its president Rilwanu Lukman said . He told a news conference here " After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC , I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices . " Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned . " We are in a position to re-confirm that , despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary , OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February , " Lu kman , who is Nigerian oil minister , said . Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva . The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs . Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level . " The idea was to suggest that OPEC 's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs , " Lukman said . He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC 's 13 members , adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd . Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement , while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified , Lukman said . " If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed , we are ready OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs , " the group 's president said . He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely . " Furthermore , no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to , " he said . Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark Lukman replied " We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials . " Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude . " We do n't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year , " Lukman said . The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers , which he said had contributed to the group 's efforts to stabilise prices , but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market . " We are quite confident , however , that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world 's reserves in OPEC hands , the future is ours . We will use that advantage responsibly , " he said . Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador 's output following an earthquake as tragic , but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster .

vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year 's severe trade deficit with the West . Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade . " It is useful to have a devaluation , " he said . " There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports . " The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today . Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow . He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners ( around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986 ) . This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s , he added . Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year . But the country 's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985 . Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year , but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs . One Western commercial attache here said " Devaluation of itself will not change anything . It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods . " Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry . It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process . He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market . Hungary 's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985 , partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen . He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year , but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation . " I am for credits to invest for that purpose , " he said . " I am against credits for consumption . " He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year , from one pct in 1986 . Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market , where he considered rates to be low . Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs , he said . On the budget deficit , which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 , Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints .

Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country 's oil industry following last week 's earthquake , officials said . Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao . Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports . Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude , to be repaid in kind after 180 days , to help meet its domestic consumption needs . The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador 's entire OPEC quota , set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987 . " All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production , " a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said . Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired , officials said . Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level , officials said . Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador 's entire quota , or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador 's Far Eastern clients . But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter , and that an announcement would be made in due course . Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired . Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake . REUTER

on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter , the Commerce Department said . The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit . The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs . For the full year 1986 , the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs , up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985 , the department said . During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs , while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs . The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance . The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs , with the largest increases in consumer goods , which rose 1.2 billion dlrs , and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada , up 900 mln dlrs each . Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada , the department said . Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Kore an-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan . On the exports side , agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs , primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports . Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil , a traditional major exporter , were limited by drought . Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs , with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter . The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries , including Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan , fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter . In the full year 1986 , imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs . Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs . Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices . The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs . Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year . The average price of rice fell 27 pct , cotton was down 22 pct , corn 18 pct , wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct . The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs . Reuter

lower even after Monday 's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct , analysts said , citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday . The Department of National Savings , effectively a Treasury Department unit , yesterday suspended its 32nd issue , launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg . A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market . The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue , the second such issue in as many weeks , analysts noted . They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue , for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downp ayment , was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later . The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active , bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact , with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct . It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar . " That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed, " said Stephen Lewis , head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew " It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further At least by a half-point immediately after the budget ( on March 17 ) , and some people hope for more . " Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was " of considerable significance . " It said , " the real message Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises . " Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates . Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut . " National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late . Building society income has been depressed in recent months , " he said . He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation . Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year 's 3.7 pct . Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices , Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct . But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings , which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts . " The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings , but he must be taking the building societies ' criticism to heart . It looks like the National Savings move reflects this ," one senior dealer said . A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation , saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates , which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market . " We are not politically motivated Funding was just becoming too expensive and we do n't need all that money ," he told Reuters , adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past , when offered interest rates were above or below market rates . He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31 . In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986 , National Saving 's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg , compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year , official figures show . Figures for February , out on Monday , are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg , pushing the total for 11 months above target , government officials said . REUTER

conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound , European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies , oil industry analysts said . They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages . However , the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms , well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties . Strevig and Associates , a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales , said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher . All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions , up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter , according to the firm 's research . " Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time , but we 're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in , " said Arthur Smith , an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich , Conn . " Europeans , especially , do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , " he added . Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar , the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them . Plenty of properties are available on the market , thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch . In two of the biggest transactions of recent months , French-owned Minatome Corp. , a unit of <Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles> , spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP> . A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions . A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms , <Petrofina S.A.> and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB> , the Oklahoma pipeline firm . But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil . Japan 's <Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc 's <TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program , and has joined with Dupont 's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal . Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property , its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula . Rich Hodges , a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp , a partnership of <Preussag Corp> and <C . Deilmann Inc> of West Germany , said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas , Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months . But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions . PaineWebber 's Geodyne Energy Income Fund , for example , has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties . " The competition is stiff , not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies , " he said . "Our company is shopping around because we feel it 's substantially less risky than pure exploration . If you 're going to take the risk inherent in exploration , you need prices higher than the current market ," he added . In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses , analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties . Houston-based Shell Oil Co , a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> , has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves , Smith said . Since 1982 , Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves , including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel , he said . " B u ying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies , " Smith said . " Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988 . " Reuter

Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities . Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal , supported by the Reagan administration , "should be seriously considered " because a refusal to do so could " play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls " placed on production . However , Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option , which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted . The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems . First , it is viewed , he said , by some as welfare . In addition , debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill , Dole said . Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program , saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country . Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it 's important to offer competitive prices . The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program , which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsid ize . Dole , who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so , again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains . The Reagan administration 's proposed farm policy changes " are not going anywhere " this year , Dole said , singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year . Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union , Dole said he did n't see any change . Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year .

ports and oil installations , the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force . Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production . The state- oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees . The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country 's main ports after a national seamen 's strike was ruled illegal last Friday . The strike by 40,000 seamen , now in its 13th day , represents a stern challenge to the government . The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange . It was a deterioration in the country 's trade balance which precipitated Brazil 's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt . There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen 's strike , which has badly hit the port of Santos the most important in South America and the country 's other main ports . Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships , but the military presence here is generally disc reet . A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight . Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship , the Docemarte , seamen 's leaders said . After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal , the men returned to work . One of the strike leaders , Elmano Barbosa , said " it is a psychological war . They are using force and we are using peaceful methods . " Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos , the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal , were working . At the seamen 's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro , spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports . Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro , seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food . The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney 's civilian government since it came to power two years ago . Yesterday , in a separate protest , hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates . The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government 's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze . Reuter

Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad , exporters said . They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike . A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil 's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year , one source added . By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations , leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March . By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped , the sources said . Given Brazil 's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day , even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather , some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April , they added .

Senate Agriculture Committee , Richard Lugar of Indiana , called for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers . " Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at the expense of American farmers and dockworkers , " Lugar said in signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal legislation . The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships rather than foreign vessels which are less costly . Reuter

Department 's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow , and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups . Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres , USDA conservation specialists said . Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres . Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program , Milton Hertz , administrator for USDA 's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday . Not all the bids will be accepted , Hertz said , but enrollment is expected to be high . As in the first three signups , the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment . " The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we 'll get signup in , " a USDA conservation specialist said . Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area , he said . Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production , but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total . A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup , USDA officials said . Under the program , USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years . The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre . Reuter

Argentina 's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Rains fell heaviest early in the week , and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province , Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces . Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires , heaviest in western sectors of the province , 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa , 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba , and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe . Rainfall was lighter in other provinces . Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes , five to 31 mm in San L uis , five to 30 mm in Entre Rios , three to 20 mm in Misiones , 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco . Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops , though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suf fered . Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather . For harvesting to resume as normal , the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate . The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires , as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm . Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares , Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area . Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted , and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost . Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily . Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage . They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants . The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires . Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area , up from seven to nine pct a week ago . Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather . Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes , down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year 's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes . Maize harvesting also advanced , reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago . The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes , down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago . Last year 's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes , according to official figures . Soybean production estimates were revised downward , to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago . Last year 's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes , according to official figures . Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward , reaching between four and six pct of total planted area , compared to two to four pct a week ago . Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes , down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest . Reuter

between the Philippines government and its bank advisory committee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks more time to consider Manila 's novel proposal for paying part of its interest bill in notes instead of cash , bankers said . The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided that they needed more time in particular to consider a news report which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging that the proposal be given serious consideration . " The banks felt that this was new information and that further consultation was called for , " one banker said . In a despatch yesterday from Washington , Reuters quoted the official as saying Manila 's plan to pay some interest with notes that could be converted into equity investments in the Philippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration strategy for handling developing country debt . " The Philippine proposal is very interesting , it 's quite unique and I do n't think it 's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand , " the official said .

the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range , financial analysts said . Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains , figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market , the analysts said . " You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now ," said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane . Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices . However , when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize , participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions , they said . " Everyone is expecting strong numbers , and if they come in as expected it wo n't be that bad for the market ," Sloane said . Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct . Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures , and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct . Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct , she added . Retail sales " will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap , " Gibbs said , referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday . June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today . Also key to debt futures direction , in addition to the federal funds rate , is the direction of crude oil prices , said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer . " A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the rang e , " Singer said . In order for bonds to break above the top of the range , which is just below 102 in the June contract , " the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit , " Singer said . " Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level . " The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich , but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel , he said . Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support . " I 'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet . The jury is still out this week , " Rozich said . Reuter

and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985 . The figures , in USX 's just-released 1986 annual report , indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves , after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations . USX , which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp , had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations . About 24 pct of total sales came from USX 's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses , which include oilfield services , raw materials , minerals , chemicals and real estate . According to the report , domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels . The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa , where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln , reflecting the exclusion of Libya . Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985 . Again , most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa , where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet , excluding Libyan reserves . U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion . In other areas , USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985 . The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27 . USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988 , representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law . The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter . In a discussion of steel results , USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed . USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations . The charge included the " indefinite idling " last month of four plants in Utah , Pennsylvania and Texas . Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania , Indiana , Alabama , Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled . " These operations are not permanently shut down . Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them ," USX said in the report . "On the other hand , a lack of any future market improvement may necessitate their permanent closing , " it added . Reuter

first votes on measures designed to toughen U.S. trade laws but held over until tomorrow the most difficult votes on controversial plans to protect American industries . Meeting in closed session , the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee failed to resolve one of the most sensitive issues in the bill--whether they will force major foreign trading partners to severely cut their trade surpluses with the United States . The subcommittee is considering a toned-down version of Democratic-sponsored trade legislation that aims to open foreign markets but which drops last year 's effort to force President Reagan to retaliate with quotas or tariffs . Congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the lawmakers intend to wrap up their proposals tomorrow and will consider a proposal to mandate retaliation without setting specific trade penalties . The legislation faces another hurdle in the full Ways and Means Committee next week before the full House votes on it . Rep. Richard Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat who is seeking his party 's 1988 presidential nomination , said he may offer an amendment to call for reductions in the trade surpluses of those countries with barriers to imports of U.S. goods . This would be a moderated version of his earlier plan to force a mandatory ten per cent annual cut in the trade surplus with the United States by Japan , South Korea , Taiwan , West Germany and other countries with the largest trade imbalances . " My criteria for a good amendment sets a standard for getting the trade deficit down , " he told reporters . The trade law changes are to become part of a major congressional and administration effort to turn around the record U.S. trade deficit of 169 billion dlrs last year by opening up foreign markets and making U.S. products more competitive . House Speaker James Wright , a Texas Democrat , said again today he expects the full House will approve the trade bill by May and that Reagan will accept the final congressional bill . " I expect whatever is reported ( by the Ways and Means Committee ) will pass . We will have a good bill and an effective bill , " he told reporters . The comprehensive trade bill will include work by other committees to ease export controls on high technology , to aid U.S. workers displaced by foreign competition , to stimulate research and development , to remove foreign trade barriers and to improve education and worker training . The lawmakers agreed that for the first time a U.S. industry could charge foreign producers with unfair competition if they deny basic worker rights such as collective bargaining , safety rules and payment of a minimum wage appropriate to the country 's economic development . They transferred to U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter the powers now held by Reagan to decide whether to retaliate against foreign violations of fair trade rules and whether an injured industry deserves import relief . They agreed to make it easier for a company to get temporary relief from import competition but agreed the industry should provide a plan to become competitive . The administration has not announced its support but Yeutter said yesterday , " I am cautiously optimistic ," that the Democratic-led House will come up with an acceptable bill . Reuter

Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his country wanted to boost joint business with France , but that a reduction of France 's trade deficit with the Soviet Union depended on the French . Murakhovsky , who is also chairman of the State Agro-Industrial Committee ( GOSAGROPROM ) , told a news conference he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French companies Rhone-Poulenc , Pechiney and Imec . Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc , packaging technology for agricultural products with Pechiney , and fruit and vegetable juice processing with Imec . An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on packaging could be signed soon , but could not give any other details . The other two companies were not immediately available for comment . Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France 's trade shortfall , at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985 , Murakhovsky told Reuters " It all depends on France . " At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased efforts to reduce the deficit . Estimates at the time showed a French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986 . Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with anybody with " interesting " proposals offering latest technology and assuring " a mutual advantage . " He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting . He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws guaranteeing " the interests of foreign partners " in joint ventures . But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the new joint venture laws . He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng . He said Doumeng 's Interagra company was preparing proposals for further examination by the Soviet Union . Doumeng last month said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of goods . Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent , and designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union 's food production capacity . Reuter

Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace on the results of talks with ecuador 's deputy energy minister fernando santos alvite , who arrived here last night . " the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its opec quota and would not affect venezuela 's , " he said . " we would from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional amounts that ecuador would be repaying us ," he said . He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be lending it a certain amount over so many days . Venezuela 's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million barrels a day , and ecuador 's has been set at 210,000 bpd . Reuter

increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations . British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy . " I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan 's domestic economy ," he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London . " But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary , " he said . " It is not just a domestic issue for Japan . If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies , particularly in the U.S. With whom Japan has so massive a surplus , " he said .

export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country 's largest defence contractor and world 's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by . Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> ( MHI ) , which began making ships and iron goods for Japan 's military rulers 130 years ago , is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets . " If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products , everyone will buy them ," MHI president Yotaro Iida said . Although two of MHI 's main businesses , shipbuilding and power plant construction , have been hit hard by the yen 's 40 pct rise against the dollar , the company has no plans to abandon them , Iida told Reuters in an interview . Its other big activity , aircraft component manufacture , has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year . " We have made the utmost efforts among the world 's manufacturers to improve productivity , " he said . " You may be surprised if you come to see our plants . The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern , with robots and computers . " Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors . The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976 . Despite its cost-cutting , MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31 , from 1985/86 's record 50.14 billion . And that includes gains from the sale of MHI 's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen . Iida is optimistic about the future , however . He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade 's average of 30 pct . MHI 's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September , from 35 to 36 pct five years ago . China is the most promising market , although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers . "Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency , " Iida said . But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support . It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales , a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future . In shipping , MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport . Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world 's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity . Domestically , MHI is involved in 12 national projects , including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites . It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence A gency 's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles , although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms . MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country 's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s . Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane , either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16 , to reduce Japan 's huge trade surplus with the U.S. " It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella , " Iida said . MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage , he said . The U.S. Has been seeking Japan 's technological support . In fiscal 1985/86 , aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI 's sales , shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct . Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct , aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct . As for the remaining 30 pct , Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods , but he declined to specify which products . "By the end of this year , you may find our brand name on your daily products , although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business ," he said . REUTER

1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold , AWB general manager Ron Paice said . " We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year , " he said in a statement . He did not detail the commitments already made , but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt , China , Iran , the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30 , the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes . Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long , cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop , with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality , he said . However , it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87 , he said . Paice did not give a crop estimate , but the AWB 's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes . But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high , based on the receivals level , and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes . The official estimate is not yet available . In the 1985/86 season , the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop . Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB 's receival system , according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data .

offer their collective resignation rather than end their 13-day-old national strike on management 's terms . The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday night . They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work under duress . President Jose Sarney 's government despatched troops to Brazil 's ports and oil installations on Tuesday . Seamen in Santos , Brazil 's main port , are in defiant mood . One of their leaders , Orlando dos Santos , told Reuters that most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations on Wednesday . The national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the country 's main ports . The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade balance . The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get , and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm the strike is doing to exports . An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners Association read , " The seamen 's strike is illegal , irrational and unpatriotic . " The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present salaries . According to officical pay lists available in the union 's office , the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977 cruzados a month , while various allowances can bring their total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month . At the other end of the scale , captains earn 7,993 cruzados a month basic pay , which is brought up to 15, 229 cruzados with allowances . " B razil 's seamen are the second worst paid in the world , after Ghana 's , " dos Santos said . He said the seamen had not received a pay increase since February 1986 , and prices have doubled since then with the collapse of the government 's Cruzado Plan price freeze . Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto , seamen and employers failed to resolve the dispute . The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct but have been offered less than half that . REUTER

inflows , implemented today , are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar , local and foreign bankers said . The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports , shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source . Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions . Meanwhile , traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade , including freight , insurance and royalties , to the central bank . But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan 's flourishing currency black market . The bankers said the controls , announced on March 6 , are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure , which has intensified over the past week , for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan 's exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs . The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70 . " I do n't think the central bank has a final target , " said an executive with a U.S. Bank . Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise . Taiwan 's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985 . The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year . Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986 . This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency . The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985 , further encouraging speculators . Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington 's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable . Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level . " Lifting exchange controls is the final answer , but the central bank is not prepared to do it . It simply does not want to take the risk ," said one local banker . He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem . The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue , he said . Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls , said an executive with a western bank . " The controls will create more paperwork , but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation , " said the manager of a European bank . Economists criticised the controls , saying they could antagonise Washington , which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan . " Instead of liberalising outflows , the government has restricted inflows , " said Kate Newman , an economist with Vickers da Costa . A local banker , who declined to be named , said , " It 's basically ridiculous . It 's a backward movement and goes against the government 's liberalisation programme . " Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds , treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year .

Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings with the 10 premiers , Mulroney said further discussions would be held in June and September to discuss the role of the provinces in approving any new trade deal . But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years ago . " It appears reasonable progress is being made ( in the talks ) ," Mulroney said . Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed , " Things are running pretty quickly now . " The talks , launched by Mulroney 's Progressive Conservative government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the U.S. , are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the world 's largest trading partnership . But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any new trading arrangement , and some of the provincial leaders complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification formula . " It 's my view that we should be thinking about these things right now , along with the questions of the substance of the agreement , " commented Ontario Premier David Peterson , who has been highly critical of the talks in the past . But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no need for a " hard and fast formula .

to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC 's official levels , industry sources said . They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel , compared to its official price of 17.42 dlrs . Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter , the sources said . The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of Iranian crude under term contracts , but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter . It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd . They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April , but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices . " If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price , " one Japanese refiner said . " We do n't intend to put pressure on them ," he added . Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower , oil traders said . They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices . Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March . The problem is likely to recur in April , adding to that country 's surplus . The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC 's December production agreement , while agreeing to the fixed prices . But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd , supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter . They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs , spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea 's Brent blend . One Japanese refiner said , " At the moment there 's a lot of pressure on OPEC , particularly on Qatar . But if they hold out there will be no problem , and I 'm beginning to trust their ability .

improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt , C.J. " Pete " Silas , chairman , told Reuters in an interview . "Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed , " he said , but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987 . Analysts estimate Phillip s " cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987 , while long term debt , which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985 , hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986 . Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties . " We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects , " he said . He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs , up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs . Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production , and most of that will be spend overseas , Silas said . " Phillips ' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the ( Ekofisk ) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earning s , " Silas said . Phillips estimates that the project , which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs , will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years . Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking " a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries ( in the offshore Xijang fields ) commercially viable . " In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello , Calif. , field started up by the fourth quarter . " We expect to start up the first platform then , " Silas said . But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets . Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed , Silas said . " We sold high cost producing assets . They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else , " Silas said . Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company . " Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt . Even the asset sales , while regrettable , were necessary to reduce debt , " Silas said . He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices do n't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels for several months . " Then , everyone would be looking at sales ( of assets ) , and we 're no different from the others , " Silas said . In other areas , Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations , which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986 , up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985 . " This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products , low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations , " Silas said , " In 1987 we think the market 's supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery .

They said Saudi Arabia was also selling oil from its crude oil stocks in tankers around the world , which OPEC says must be counted towards a member 's production quota . Saudi Arabia 's quota is 4.133 mln bpd . The lower production levels indicated Saudi Arabia , the world "s largest oil exporter , was insisting on getting Opec official prices , even at the cost of lower production , the sources said . King Fahd reiterated yesterday , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Vis news , the Saudi commitment to OPEC 's December pact to boost oil prices to an average 18 dlrs . " Saudi Arabia is completely sticking to OPEC decisions , " he said . The sources said the kingdom 's exports from Gulf ports averaged one mln bpd during the eight days ending last Sunday , down from a February average of 1.9 mln bpd .

The kingdom 's main buyers , the four U.S. Oil firms with past stakes in the national oil company Aramco Mobil , Exxon , Texaco and Chevron enjoy considerable flexibility in the timing and volume of their liftings but are bound to pay official prices , the sources said .

preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders open to private importers , grain traders and officials said . Under the terms of Portugal 's January 1986 accession to the European Community , EC , a grain import monopoly held by EPAC ( Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais ) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 . Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country 's annual import needs . The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders . Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon 's civil court , in a preliminary ruling , had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders . Trade sources said the ruling , though effective immediately , was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings . A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that , as a result of the court 's decision , the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn . Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC 's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal 's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency 's import monopoly . It also said the participation of EPAC , which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network , was unfair competition to the private traders . Traders said they believed the EC 's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute , preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue .

Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month . In an interview with Reuters , Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef and citrus exports . Lyng , who plans to be in Japan April 14-27 , said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market . " We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market ," he said . The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the U.S. would request . " We 've got none of it now . If we got one per cent of it , it would be a big improvement , " he said . Last year , the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions . However , the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice exports . Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas , but that his visit " may be a forerunner in a general way " to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988 . He said , however , that the U.S. " will ask for a definite liberalization of those items ( beef and citrus ) When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese , it means do away with the quota .

pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela , PDVSA , to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi , Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific 's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary . The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery 's products . A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction . There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York . The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day , the Union Pacific spokesman said , and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction . The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector . Purchase of part of Champlin 's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition . One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence . The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp 's <SL C > Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary . In that agreement signed September 15 , 1986 , PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Cit go 's stock . The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin 's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply , trade sources said . In the earlier deal with Southland , PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feeds tocks . Reuter

rejected an Interior Department draft plan to open wilderness lands in Northern Alaska to oil and gas exploration . The federation , the nation 's largest conservation group , said further study was needed to assess any possible damage that development might have on the wildlife in the area , the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . Jay Hair , the federation 's executive vice president , called the Interior 's research into the effects of development " so fundamentally flawed that it provides little or no basis on which to make a public policy decision . " Hair called the department 's proposal a " ref lection of a largely political decision , " adding " we have no confidence in Interior to represent the broad public interest in this area . " Interior wants to open the 1.5 million acre coastal plain to oil and gas exploration , but it said only with tough safeguards to protect the area 's caribou and musk-oxen . It said a preliminary survey showed the region could hold billions of barrels of oil and gas , and that its potential as an energy resource would never be known without exploration . Interior said oil on the coastal plain could match the 10 billion barrels found at Prudhoe Bay , just west of the plain . Under existing law , Congress must agree to oil and gas exploration , and if it does not act , the land will remain a wildlife refuge protected from commercial development . Hair said Interior 's report failed to stress the probability that finding recoverable oil is only 19 pct . He said Interior 's study also failed to weigh oil , gas , fish and wildlife information the State of Alaska had gathered nor had the department consulted the Environmental Protection Agency on the possible effects of exploration . The federation , in letters to Congressmen , proposed that a nine-member commission be set up to study all aspects of the issue and report back to Congress in about two years . Hair said the federation was not opposed to the possible exploration of oil , only that Interior 's study was inadquate to make a sound judgement . Congressional observers said that at present there was little sentiment in Congress to open the wildlife area for commercial exploitation dispite increasing concern that the United States is becoming overly dependent on foreign oil . reuter

pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions . " We have a budget driven farm policy . It may be a shame , but we are locked into this ," said Dan Glickman , ( D-Kans. ) , chairman of the subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feed grains . " We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer . A 0/92 plan , if properly done , could do both . " Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains . An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week . Glickman said a 0/92 program , which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment , would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill . It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill , he said , but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals , a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices , as USDA has proposed . A 0/92 plan , however , would not be decoupling , but simply a different type of acreage diversion program , Glickman said . Decoupling delinking planting decisions from government payments is too much of a policy change to approve at this point , he said . " I do n't think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year . Period . Unequivocal , " Glickman said at the hearing . Sen. Rudy Boschwitz ( R-Minn. ) , cosponsor of the Bore n/Boschwitz decoupling plan , said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan . Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate . His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers , require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only , prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage , limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions . " I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 , but we can at least move in that direction , " Boschwitz said . Robbin Johnson , vice president of Cargill , Inc. , testified in favor of decoupling . Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers ' dependency on the government , he said . A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling , Johnson said , and would still encourage farmers to plant . Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen 's Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers . But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program , Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels .

certificates has helped ease storage problems and is a necessary part of export promotion programs , a senior executive for the world 's largest grain company said . Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains , Robbin Johnson , vice president of Cargill , Inc. , disputed claims that U.S. grain companies have made huge profits from certificate trading . " The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the trade , " he said . Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing with a two pct spread in certificate transactions , and that this is within the normal grain marketing levels . Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of certificates as compared to cash , but said that critics need to look more closely at the savings caused by certs , noting for example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs . Certificates are also an important part of any export promotion program , he said . " The more you look at ways to expand export markets , the more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain into the market to meet demand , " he said .

" This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism', " Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat said . The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year . But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep.

Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , has not decided the exact form of his amendment , an aide said . Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut by those countries . The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls , incentives for research , expanded worker training and education and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness . The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate committees . It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by U.S. actions against other countries . The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win relief from surges of imports of competitive products .

" This product could very well be toughening our trade policy and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this frightening word 'protectionism', " Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat said . The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year . But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by countries such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan . Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , has not decided the exact form of his amendment , an aide said . Last year the House approved his idea to force an annual 10 pct trade surplus cut by those countries . Reuter

discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is " on hold " and may not be changed for weeks or even months , economists said . " The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy ," said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. " These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect , nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change , " said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists ' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks . The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs , up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period , but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that . It said that banks ' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously . Finally , the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February , with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs . Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3 . February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987 . The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct . There is no M-1 target . " In the near term , there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy , even apart from the slowdown in money growth ," said Stephen Slifer , economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February 's anemic growth rates . However , they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness . Commenting on February 's decline in the key M-2 aggregate , Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks . This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while , he said , so February 's weakness is not likely to persist . Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March . Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed . Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves . Given the economy 's fragility in many sectors , the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise , rather than lower , interest rates when it next changes policy . "Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them , although Fed funds held above six pct , " said Williams of Bankers Trust . Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday , up from 6.06 pct in the prior week . The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday , 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday . On Tuesday , it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases . Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven . They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs . Reuter

barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help it meet its export commitments , Energy and Mines Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today . He said that under the terms of this loan , agreed during a visit here this week by Ecuador 's Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite , Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in August . Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to offsetting the loss of Ecuador 's 140,000 in exports caused by earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week . Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao was put out of action . Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd , while Ecuador 's is 210,000 bpd . Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses . Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs . The oil , part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by Venezuela , will be processed at Guayaquil refineries . " If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this country would have ground to a halt , " he said . Reuter

eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe , economists say . But many economists say the system , which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands , remains in its infancy . Its new currency , the European Currency Unit ( Ecu ) , has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar . And on Wednesday , the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe 's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world 's first Ecu coin . But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system 's founding fathers , ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing . Under this phase , originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up , decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund . But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters . " The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common , " said one economist who has closely watched the system 's development . The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies , accentuating what the economists say is the system 's greatest weakness , its vulnerability to a weak dollar . Over the past 18 months , as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies , the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system . MORE As the mark soared against the dollar , it also rose against EMS currencies less favoured by international investors . And as West Germany last year refused to give in pressure from several EC partners and the United States to cut interest rates to slow the mark 's rise , the EMS had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community . Two months ago the mark and the Dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the Belgian and Luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the French franc , Italian lira , the Irish punt and Danish crown . Another frustration has been Britain 's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound , still a major world currency , outside the system . No change in the British government 's attitude is expected before the country 's next general elections , due by mid-1988 . Meanwhile , the system 's last realignment , the 11th since it was set up , prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC 's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it . Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month . But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details . They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change . " Technical measures wo n't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness . For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level , " said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank 's economic research department . Economists say the system 's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates . If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence , they predict . REUTER

Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors , which were expected to boost futures prices on today 's open . The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn , ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials . Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official 's statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs . Reuter

Petrobras has asked the Army to withdraw the troops which were occupying its oil installations since Tuesday , Petrobras said in a statement . The statement said the request for the withdrawal of the troops was made because of the calmness reigning in all of its refineries .

Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres , so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week . However , some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices , citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers .

buyer of Yugoslav corn since October , purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year , according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belg rade . Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87 , with most of this sold to the Soviet Union , the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official . In a report dated March 10 , the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered , with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June . An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September , the grain associaiton said , so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes , the counselor said . Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union , the counselor said . Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1 , higher than earlier estimates of 150,000 , the official said . The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year , he said . Reuter

gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy , economists said . " If you 're the Fed , there 's no reason to do anything ," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. " There are hints that GNP is picking up . On the inflation front , all is well ," he said . " Money supply is well under control . It 's an absolutely ideal situation . " February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct , slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected . This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January 's production number , previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase . The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct , less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise . This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January . " The Fed is going to look at this positively , " said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation . " Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker ( Fed Chairman ) has said lately . Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants . " The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February , after a 9.8 pct increase in January . " This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barre l , " said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. " The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year . " In 1986 , declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected , but a sharp drop in auto prices was not . Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct . Yesterday , Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve . " The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today , " said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International . While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy , Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar . " The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air , " he said . " We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers . " Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February 's PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas , this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness , he said . If further dollar declines are needed , this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt , Brusca added , which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices . By contrast , Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987 . Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers ' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire , and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar . David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 , which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output . " It 's the other side of the lower dollar , " Wyss said . " Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output . " Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter . " It 's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive . " But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains . He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output . Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production . Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January , but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced , not that manufacturing activity gained . Finally , he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units . " In the first quarter , it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate , but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate , " Roach said . " The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventorie s . " Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 . January business inventories rose 0.9 pct , the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct , the Commerce Department said . Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January , the largest monthly sales drop on record . Nonetheless , economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes . " The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months , " Ramirez said . " They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months . " Reuter

little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country 's main oil installations occupied three days ago . The troops went in at the request of the state- oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees . Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops . The situation in the refineries was calm , it said , and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal . A national seamen 's strike , however , continued and marines remained in the country 's main ports . The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen 's strike , now two weeks old , was ruled illegal last Friday . A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound , 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports . Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals , Global and Flumar , struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase . Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end . Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil 's 40,000 seamen were still on strike . The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding . Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday . Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator . Besides industrial troubles , there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector . On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates . Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today , with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana . The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance . On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks . Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange . Reuter

competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn , industry and government officials said . As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn , industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely . First , there are supply concerns . Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year 's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes , rather than the 210 mln announced , therby increasing the Soviet need for grain . A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying , an Agriculture Department source said . Dry weather in Argentina a major corn supplier to the USSR and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes , down from 11.5 mln . Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes . Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year 's corn for export , a USDA official said , with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR . " Significant downside potential " still exists for the Argentine crop , the official said , which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow . " If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking , then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period , " he said . Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying . U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne , Argentine corn for 67 dlrs a very competitive price spread , U.S. and Soviet sources said . " This price difference makes American corn competitive , " Albert Melnikov , commercial counselor for the Soviet Union , told Reuters . Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise , and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices , the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy , sources said . Finally , some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement ( four mln tonnes ) , the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat . In an inteview with Reuters this week , USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer , but that such an offer had not been ruled out . Reuter

is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws . The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign unfair trade practices against other domestic industries . The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge . The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be approved . In investigations involving a processed agricultural product , trade associations of processors or producers would have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair duties . The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . It would seek fair trade in agriculture , seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and export practices , to eliminate tariffs , subsidies , quotas and non-tariff barriers . President Reagan 's authority to negotiate a new GATT agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended through January 3 , 1991 . The bill extends Reagan 's authority to negotiate an international coffee agreement through October 31 , 1989 . It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar imported from November 1 , 1977 to March 31 , 1985 for production of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for re-ex port . The export of the sugar or products must occur before Octoer 1 , 1991 . Presently , to qualify for the refund the sugar must be processed within three years after import and exported within five years . Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from imports . Reuter

The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies . And initially , traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower . But by Wednesday , the dollar climbed to more than 1.87 marks , about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord . The move was aided by indications that the U.S. economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing . But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines . Dealers differed as to whether the U.S. central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 1.87 marks , or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions . But the dollar quickly backed off . It hovered today around 1.85 marks . " The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon , " said Marine Midland NA 's O'Neill . Also on Wednesday , London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the U.K. currency rose to 1.60 dlrs compared with 1.5355 dlrs before the G-6 pact . Sterling , along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar , was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar/mark and dollar/yen . The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving U.K. economy , anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election . " There was a real run on sterling , " said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Sterling traded today around 1.5750 dlrs , down from 1.5870 dlrs last night . It slid to 2.917 marks from 2.950 yesterday and from a peak of about 2.98 recently . " There 's been some heavy profit-taking on sterling/mark ahead of next Tuesday 's U.K. budget , " said James McGroarty of Discount Corp. As speculators detected the presence of the U.S. and British central banks , they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars . But here too they were stymied . The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currency 's rise . The Canadian dollar traded at 1.3218/23 per U.S. dollar today , down from 1.3185/90 yesterday . And the Australian Reserve Bank , using the Fed as agent , sold Australian dollars in the U.S. yesterday , dealers said . The Australian dollar fell to a low of 67.45/55 U.S. cents today from a high of 69.02 Thursday . Analysts said the central banks ' moves to stifle sudden upward movement , leave the market uncertain about its next step . Today , the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months . The dollar fell to 152.35/40 yen from 153.35/40 last night . Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling/short mark positions established lately . " B ecause of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy , the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen , " a dealer at one U.K. bank said . Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders , lower industrial output and slowing employment gains . Moreover , the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas , for example in Australian financial instruments , repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 . Noting that the dollar/yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan , analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar 's downward scope against the Japanese currency . In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January , the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28 . On that day , the dollar fell as low as 150.40 yen . " Sure , the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January . But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes , " said McGroarty of Discount . Reuter

figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish , although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact . " O ut of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn That 's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for , " Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said . The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres . Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures , but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly . The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31 . Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln . Richard Loewy , analyst with Prudential Bache Securities , said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures . " The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing , " he added . The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures . Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans , and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures . Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring , he said " The trade was definitely looking higher , so certificates are going to be less than expected . " The USDA offered a special corn " bonus " rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates . The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel , based on the farm program payment yield for corn , for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve . Katharina Zimmer , analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures , said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected , although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures . " I think it is friendly for the market , at least in the long run , " she said . Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition. " It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program , " she said . Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up . She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres , she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's . Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres . New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program , despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures .

The contract , to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin Petroleum 's parent company , the Union Pacific Corp , will create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining . The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of 30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin . Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash , plus an additional 60 mln in crude and refined oil shipments . PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new company 's working capital , the Venezuelan company said . Under the deal , PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more mostly gasoline and distillates through Champlin 's distribution system in 10 U.S. states . The new company will be directed by a six-member board , with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific . According to PDVSA , Venezuelans will occupy such key positions such as treasurer and vice-president for manufacturing . The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates . The plant will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes , which make up more than half of the country 's crude oil exports . Reuter

mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments and its domestic energy demand , Ecuadorean Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement . Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake . Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export commitments , Espinosa said . Also , Venezuela will sell the crude and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador , he said . Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao , a task that would take an estimated five months . Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for refining in this country to meet domestic demand . Ecuador would repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired . Both countries are the only Latin American members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) . Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the earthquake , Energy Ministry officials said . Its total output was around 260,000 bpd . Reuter

unlikely to hold any surprises that will shake U.S. interest rate futures out of their relatively narrow trading range of the last 3-1/2 months , financial analysts said . "People do n't seem to have any firm conviction about the current strength of the economy or about the Federal Reserve doing anything ," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Norman Mains . The narrow range trading is also taking its toll on trading volume , he noted . " We 've had a decline in activity as recent economic statistics have not greatly changed people 's viewpoints on interest rates , " Mains said . The data , which has provided not clear-cut view of the economy , coupled with dampened activity in the foreign exchange markets after the Paris initiative has made for " less than ebullient market action , " Mains said . He added , however , that Treasury bond futures could be in for a retracement after the recent rise as they are near the top of the trading range . " My view is that the economy remains relatively strong and market participants will see that current prices are unjustified , " Mains said . Refco Inc senior vice president Michael Connery also noted that the market is showing very little momentum and lacks retail interest . " All of the movement occurs at the opening , " afterwhich volume dwindles and momentum fades , Connery said . Although data during the week was mildly positive for bond prices , the small rise in February producer prices and downward revisions in January retail sales and industrial production were " not real exciting , " said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner . " There is no one factor that will push us through the highs at this moment , " Leiner said . Next week 's revision to fourth quarter U.S. Gross national Product is also likely to be of little interest to the market , said Kleinwort Benson chief financial economist Sam Kahan . Still , forecasts for first quarter GNP could play a role in the direction of bond prices over the next month . Kahan said his early estimate for first quarter growth is around three pct , due largely to a buildup in inventories reflected in the January inventory data Friday , which showed the largest increase since 1979 . " The key question will be not whether there is a large increase in first quarter GNP , but whether any increase is sustainable or a one shot deal , " Kahan said . He said that a sizable increase in first quarter GNP stemming from an increase in inventories will be a drag on second quarter growth . If that is the case , GNP in the second quarter could ease back to a one to two pct growth rate , Kahan said . Reuter

producer <Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern <Petro Chemie> , the official Tanjug news agency said . Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical , chemical , textile and plastics industries . The Yugoslav firms , in turn , will export oil products to France . Tanjug said this year 's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs . Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany 's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago . Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects , involving Yugoslavia 's other main producer <Naftagas > of Novi Sad , with partners in Angola , Algeria and Tunisia , exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas . An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years , Tanjug said . Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia 's total oil production , which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year . Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia 's leading export enterprises . In a separate statement issued through Tan jug , Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes , in Tunisia .

missiles near the Strait of Hormuz which increase the threat to shipping in the Gulf , the New York Times said .

Styx missiles have a range of up to 50 miles . It said the missiles had been deployed at two sites and quoted a naval analyst as saying they could be used to sink a supertanker and block the Strait of Hormuz . Missiles now used by Iran had only a fraction of the explosive power of the Styx and could sink a supertanker only with a lucky hit , the paper said .

At a rally in this city , about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo , about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met . Wilson Gomes de Moura , president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees ' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers , told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks . The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras . The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation , but the troops were removed yesterday . Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday . The government has also sent marines into the main ports . A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise .

President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation , but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation . However , Baldrige warned measures that would penalise trading partners such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. Could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill .

said OPEC 's December agreement to stabilise oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it . Nazer , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Vis news , said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil , well below its OPEC quota . Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest oil exporter , will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact , Nazer said . The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1 . Nazer , in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October , said " I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our ( next OPEC ) meeting will take place as scheduled . " Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements . " We 've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified , " he said . OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact . Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline . Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price . "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December , Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement , " he said . Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait , but not sales from floating storage , Nazer said . King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11 , said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC . " Saudi Arabia does n't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability , " he said . Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of " swing producer " within OPEC . Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states . " Saudi Arabia is not playing that role . It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC , " Nazer said . Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd . But he said if circumstances changed " I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures . " Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer . Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers . Norway , Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC 's behalf earlier this year . " We did not ask any country to do anything . These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions , " Nazer said . He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate such as Britain to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit . REUTER

And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community ( EC ) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow . EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission 's proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations . The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package , due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month , of the EC 's Common Agricultural Policy widely seen as the root cause of the EC 's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners . The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production , rather than a straight forward tax . They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output , but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units , over two billion dlrs , in farm costs . It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters , led by the United States . The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world , ranging from Senegal , Malaysia and Indonesia , to Brazil , Argentina , Canada , Iceland and Norway . The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments , with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain , and Denmark , the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom . Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy , France and Greece , which backed similar proposals in the past , did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected . But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action , and the foreign ministers ' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument . The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports . The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill , if enacted , would provoke swift EC retaliation . REUTER

leaders assembled for a conference aimed at thrashing out problems facing the private sector of the kingdom 's oil-dependent economy . The meeting of some 500 top businessmen from across Saudi Arabia comes at a time of guarded optimism in industry and commerce following the OPEC pact to boost world oil prices . The four-day conference in this resort town , high in the mountains above the Tihamah plain stretching to the Red Sea , has been organised by Saudi Arabia 's chambers of commerce . Finance Minister Mohammed Ali Abal-Khail and Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim will attend the first day . Bankers and businessmen said the conference will air problems facing commerce and industry after last year 's slide in oil prices and examine ways to promote higher investment in a private sector sorely short of finance . Government planners have long recognised that Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest crude exporter , needs to foster private enterprise to diversify its oil-based economy . The fledgling private sector was hard hit by the Middle East recession as early as 1983 and several big manufacturing and trading companies ran into problems repaying loans . Renewed optimism this year stems largely from the accord reached by OPEC last December to curb oil output and boost prices to a benchmark level of 18 dlrs per barrel . With oil prices recovering , Saudi Arabia went ahead at the turn of the year with long-delayed budget plans incorporating a 52.7 billion riyal deficit to be bridged by drawing down foreign reserves . The simple act of publishing a budget restored a measure of confidence to the business community . Some share prices have risen by more than 35 pct since last November , while banks are generally reporting a slowdown in the number of new non-performing loans . But not all bankers are convinced . One senior corporate finance manager in Riyadh said " Banks are still reluctant to lend There is certainly more optimism in the air , but I am not sure if it is firmly based . " Some businessmen and bankers point out that government spending is still under tight control and the non-oil economy may still be contracting . Capital expenditure on large projects has been cut sharply . A U.S. Embassy report on Saudi Arabia published just before the budget said " While industrialisation has continued to be one of the government 's highest priorities , the recession , the payments problem and the lack of financing have reduced Saudi and foreign investor interest in industry . " It is the lack of fresh investment that is expected to be a major issue among the businessmen gathered here . Official figures show the number of new licences for industrial ventures fell 24 pct in the six months to March 1986 , compared with the same period in 1985 . Lending by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund , a major source of industry backing , has fallen steadily since 1983 . Trading companies have also been hit , some caught with huge inventories of construction equipment as recession bit . Some firms laid off workers and cut bloated inventories . Others have effectively been liquidated . A few have reached agreement with bankers to extend debt repa yments . The latest rescheduling is for the shipping-to-hotels conglomerate REDEC . Its negotiators have just initialled a draft accord to restructure payments on 1.3 billion riyals of bank debt . Bankers and businessmen said the conference was also likely to discuss the apparent reluctance of U.S. And British firms to step up investment in the kingdom . A British government delegation has just left Riyadh after holding preliminary talks on ways of offsetting the huge Saudi outlay on a defence contract to supply 132 fighter aircraft worth five billion stg .

again next month to review their accord on currency stability , but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth . The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month 's talks seem likely to build on that stability . A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm . But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood , " That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels . That is in fact what has happened since Paris . " Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives . Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals , but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings . The official refused to comment , however , on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year . On February 22 , the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions , given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth . The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks . " I think these changes will strengthen the President 's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora , " said the official , an Administration economic policymaker . " So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives . " But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability . Last week , dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark , which had breached 1.86 to the dollar . British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling 's strength . International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers , who will review market performance and their own economic prospects , will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund . The sources said Italy , which refused to join the Paris pact , was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker . Since Paris , there are signs West German growth is slowing , while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing . Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank ( central bank ) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit . A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany . But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank . " If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it , it would no longer be private , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged , but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high , further coordinated action could be on the April agenda .

exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country 's international reserves , a government decree in the Official Gazette said . Under the system , importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange . The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange . Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago . The system will be effective until the end of 1988 . A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank , the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes . The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council . Peru 's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary central bank estimates . Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985 . Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8.5 pct , the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years . Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary estimates . The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3 billion dlr foreign debt . REUTER

currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan 's trade surplus with the U.S. , A senior trade official said . Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation . Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S responded to Taiwan 's request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May . Taiwan 's surplus with the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 . Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year . Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 . It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value . It rose four cents against the U.S. Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59 . Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise . REUTER

surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year 's bumper harvest , agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday . The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes , but only a fraction of this was marketed , with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it . The state-owned National Milling Corp ( NM C ) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country . NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity , concentrated in Dar es Salaam , Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania . In addition , the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity , he added . Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of Iringa , Mbeya , Ruvuma and Ru kwa . REUTER

February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs , from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion , market economists polled by Reuters said . Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow . The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January , after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs . As an example they quoted wheat export volume , which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January . A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit , the economists said . Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments , they said . They said the Australian dollar , which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level , should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs .

International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies , an official newspaper said . The Times of Zambia , which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) , quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them . President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December , in line with IMF recommendations , but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots in which 15 people were killed . The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances , but they are estimated to cost the government about 500 mln kwacha per year . The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government 's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia 's foreign exchange auction . The central bank 's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January , pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate . The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction system , losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months . However , since the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar . Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency 's devaluation once the auctions restart . According to the Times of Zambia , the IMF team , led by assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah , is due to conclude its talks with the government on schedule on March 23 . The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its talks with the government have taken longer than expected . REUTER

having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves , Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa 'i said . " First , the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved , " he said in a television interview Saturday . " The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide ( the ) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments . " Rifa 'i said Jordan 's outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct . The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September , according to latest Central Bank figures . Rifa 'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar , which is pegged to a basket of currencies , is overvalued . " The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability , " he said . The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978 , Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria , Iraq , Kuwait , Libya , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel . But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations , while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices . REUTER

weighing rules for banks ' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments , banking sources said . Interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny , and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the U.S. And U.K. To Japan . Juergen Becker , director of the Bundesbank 's division of banking law and credit supervision , said the U.S.-British proposals were interesting , but declined to elaborate . But banking sources said West Germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals . " There is no formal plan yet , but talks are in the latter stages , " one representative of the German Banking Association in Cologne said . Bankers expect rule changes this year . All alterations must be approved by the Bundesbank , West Germany 's four major banking associations and the Federal Banking Supervisory Office . Talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of Germany 's credit law , which has been in effect since 1934 . Authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it , banking sources said . Since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks ' lending to 18 times shareholders ' equity plus reserves , on a consolidated basis . But lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts , currency and interest swaps , commercial paper programs , currency options , interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges . The sources said the main value of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor , and , for instance , in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps . But even if German banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps , they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk . U.S.-British proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps , whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary , especially when counterparties remain anonymous . This is the so-called market-to-market value . But German authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved , the sources said . The weightings , also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks ' securities portfolios , are zero for public authorities , 20 pct for domestic banks , 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers . A further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the U.S. And the U.K. May put German banks at a competitive disadvantage , the sources said . Stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the U.S.-U.K. Proposals could far exceed the intent of the U.S. And British authorities , the sources said . One specialist for Dresdner Bank AG said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could , for instance , be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap , despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different . How new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain . Many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds . But as their equity capital is fairly small , tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks ' freedom of movement , particularly in the growing business of currency swaps , if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet , the sources added .

yen around its current range , a senior central bank official told reporters . He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions , a dollar fall or a dollar rise . Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability , but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks , he said . The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time , the senior bank official said , but declined to be more specific . Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy . Asked what factors might destabilize the markets , the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention , a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan , the U.S. Or West Germany , or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down . The senior bank official said he expects Japan 's gross national product ( G NP ) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April . That would be little changed from the performance expected this year . Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88 , but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point , he said . He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy . The economy 's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy , he added . The central bank 's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy , the senior bank official said . The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half . Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation , there could be some problems in the future , he said . " We are sitting on a barrel of powder , but fortunately it may still be wet , " he added . Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substan tially , he said . The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices , the bank official said . This inflow of funds into the stock exchange , occurring also in other countries , may continue , he said . The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year . "He 's a great man , " the official said , adding that more and more people expect his reappointment . Turning to exchange rates , the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade , even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through . Even the U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact , although so far it has not been very strong , he said . REUTER

In a report to President Corazon Aquino on his department 's performance during the year ended February 28 , Ongpin said at least 15.9 billion pesos were expected to accrue from new tax reform measures announced last year . He said the goal for official development assistance ( ODA ) this year is two billion dlrs , adding that aid donors have committed ODA inflows of 1.7 billion dlrs in 1987 , up 30 pct from 1.3 billion in 1986 . Ongpin said steps planned to provide a sound revenue base included a value added tax ( VAT ) system due to be introduced in 1988 . He gave no other details . He said treasury bill maturities , interest rate levels and the volume of government securities sold to the private sector have improved significantly . " In particular , short-term prime interest rates which had gone over 40 pct in 1985 , are now down to less than 10 pct , " he said . Ongpin said the government 's debt-equity scheme , introduced in August last year , had attracted more than 276 mln dlrs worth of applications , but selective evaluation had resulted in approvals of only 61.8 mln dlrs at end-February . He said his department aims to accelerate its privatisation program and the sale of non-performing assets owned by associates of former President Ferdinand Marcos to achieve a 1987 sales target of four billion pesos which would help finance land reform . Aquino said earlier this month that all the 24 billion pesos the government hopes to raise from the sale of the failed companies will be used to finance the land reform plan . Ongpin also said the government would pursue efforts to obtain 500 mln dlrs in concessional funding for the program from a World Bank-led consultative group of multilateral and bilateral aid donors . The government has said the land reform plan aims to distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to poor peasants . REUTER

money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct , dealers said . They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct . Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move . It had been 3.80/90 on Friday . The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January . Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients . Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month , with the bulk being paid out next week . In anticipation of this liquidity drain , banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank . On Thursday , minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday . Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion . The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month . With the heavy tax drain in March , banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary . However , a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain .

Ecuador has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd . MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second , in addition to output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait . MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of its total production into floating storage . Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output , including Neutral Zone production , was around three mln bpd . The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd , compared with its 948,000 bpd quota , and that actual liftings are much lower than that . It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March because Libya was insisting on official prices , but is still lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a further 25,000 bpd of " purchase crud e . " It said small equity producers , with entitlements of only 2,000 to 3,000 bpd , had also told Tripoli they could not lift at official prices . MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member countries calling for the formation of a committee to study what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among various members . The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was having difficulty selling crude at official prices . The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC price regulations exports of refined products , equity crude on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and " other forms of hydrocarbons " which are marketed in package deals with crude oil .

Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make payments , but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments . Ecuador said on Friday that last week 's earthquake was forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision based on the slide in world oil prices to suspend debt payments to private foreign banks , which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt . " All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour , " the president said during a visit to the quake zone . " A government as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain . " Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able to meet its commitments , Febres Cordero said . He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17 dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that . Meanwhile , Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the earthquake , which killed at least 300 people .

mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports , wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country recover from a devastating earthquake , bankers said . But the French bank 's plan , which would effectively postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several months , is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52 members of the loan syndicate . The pipeline that carries all Ecuador 's oil exports was ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair . President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that Ecuador as a result would maintain January 's suspension of interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt . Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the price of oil , which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador 's export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue . Although sympathetic to Ecuador 's plight , many banks in the Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job for international financial organizations and not for commercial banks , bankers said . The 18-month oil-financing facility , which was signed last October 28 , is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a Latin American nation since the region 's debt crisis erupted in August 1982 . Because it was a voluntary deal , many bankers feel strongly that the orginal terms must be adhered to . Otherwise , they fear , the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions for Latin borrowers will be set back . " There 's a lot of reluctance by the other banks . They feel it 's a different facility , and so any kind of suggestion of a restructuring would look bad , " one banker commented . Reuter

said OPEC 's December agreement to stabilize oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel was being implemented satisfactorily and there was no immediate need to change it . Nazer , in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Vis news , said Saudi Arabia was producing around three mln barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude oil , well below its OPEC quota . Saudi Arabia , the world 's largest oil exporter , will continue to restrain production as long as other OPEC members adhere to the pact , Nazer said . The 13-nation OPEC agreed in December to cut its production ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and abide by fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1 . Nazer , in his first interview since succeeding Ahmed Zaki Yamani last October , said " I do not foresee any need for new measures before the 25th of June when our ( next OPEC ) meeting will take place as scheduled . " Nazer said OPEC was producing below 15.8 mln bpd and all members were abiding by its agreements . " We 've heard news every now and then of violations but they were not at all verified , " he said . OPEC production curbs have boosted world oil prices from a 13-year low of around eight dlrs a barrel last August to near 18 dlrs after announcement of the December pact . Spot market prices slipped some two dlrs in February but have firmed in the past two weeks to near OPEC levels as traders gained confidence in OPEC price and output discipline . Nazer said Saudi Arabia would continue to produce below its 4.133 mln bpd quota if necessary to defend the 18 dlr price . "As long as all the OPEC members adhere to the program as devised in December , Saudi Arabia will continue to adhere to the agreement , " he said . Current production of three mln bpd includes oil from the Neutral Zone shared with Kuwait , but not sales from floating storage , Nazer said . King Fahd of Saudi Arabia , in an interview with Reuters and Visnews on March 11 , said the kingdom wanted oil price stability and called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with OPEC . " Saudi Arabia does n't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability , " he said . Nazer said the output level did not mean the kingdom had returned to a role of " swing producer " within OPEC . Saudi Arabia allowed its output to sink as low as two mln bpd in August 1985 to compensate for slack demand and over-production by some OPEC states . " Saudi Arabia is not playing that role . It is being played by OPEC membership as a whole because the reduction in the 15.8 mln bpd share of OPEC in the market is being shared by other members of OPEC , " Nazer said . Nazer said OPEC estimated demand for its oil during third quarter this year would be around 16.6 mln bpd . But he said if circumstances changed " I am sure then the OPEC members will consult with each other and take the necessary measures . " Oil analysts say the OPEC pact could come under strain when demand for petroleum products generally falls in the northern hemisphere spring and summer . Nazer said he was satisfied with the extent of cooperation from non-OPEC producers . Norway , Egypt and the Soviet Union agreed to help OPEC by restraining production or exports after he visited them on OPEC 's behalf earlier this year . " We did not ask any country to do anything . These were programmes they thought were necessary to stabilise market conditions and to help themselves attain better pricing conditions , " Nazer said . He said it was up to countries that declined to cooperate such as Britain to come up with their own proposals if they saw fit .

to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo 's three billion dlr military debt , Egyptian officials said . One official , who asked to remain anonymous , told Reuters a draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future interest payable on the 10 year-old debt , and set a 25 year repayment term . Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday . Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha , who leaves for Moscow on Tuesday , met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue . One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate for trade with the Soviet Union . Current commerce is based on a rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar which Moscow sees as unreasonable . The fluctuating official rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar . The officials said part of the debt would be paid in exports of goods such as textiles , leather and furniture . Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the door for new cooperation , mainly in modernising Soviet-built steel , aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year development plan ending June 30 1992 . Egypt , which already imports Soviet coal , wood , newsprint and glass , also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military hardware , the officials said . An estimated 65 pct of Egypt 's arsenal is still made up of Soviet-supplied equipment , one official said . Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977 when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-s tanding ally and turned to the U.S. . REUTER

exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country 's international reserves , a government decree in the Official Gazette said . Under the system , importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange . The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange . Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago . The system will be effective until the end of 1988 . A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank , the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes . The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council . Peru 's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985 , according to preliminary central bank estimates . Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985 . Reuter

currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan 's trade surplus with the U.S. , A senior trade official said . Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation . Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S responded to Taiwan 's request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May . Taiwan 's surplus with the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 . Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year . Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 . It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value . It rose four cents against the U.S. Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59 . Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise . REUTER

Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil credit guarantees . Petrobras cancelled a 40 mln dlr crude oil purchase from the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of credit from the official Bank of Brazil . The Saudis had demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading international banks . Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did not change their mind by Monday , Petrobras would negotiate the purchase of oil with other producers .

European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses . At a meeting of EC foreign ministers , Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC , diplomats said . West Germany , also opposed to the oils and fats tax , will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers , they added . They said West Germany 's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors , the president of the EC 's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis . Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts ( MCAs ) a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports . Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who , without MCAs , would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states , which means virtually all other 11 EC states , diplomats said . Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations . The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal , describing it as a breach of the EC 's obligations under the world trade body GATT . But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC , such as Senegal , Malaysia , Indonesia , Brazil , Argentina , Iceland and Norway , they added . Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today , diplomats said . But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month , they added . REUTER

Baldrige predicted Congress will pass a reasonable trade bill this year and said tough protectionist legislation could prompt a trade war . " The mood of the Congress right now is as tough on trade as I 've ever seen it in six years in Washington , " Baldrige said in a weekend television interview . " I think we 'll still be able to get a reasonable trade bill out in spite of that because the whole Congress is trying to work together with the administration , but there is a hardening trade attitud e , " he said . President Reagan opposes protectionist legislation but agreed to support a trade bill when it became apparent that opposition Democrats would pass such legislation . However , Baldrige warned measures that would penalize trading partners such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan for failing to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. could lead to retaliation and he said he would urge Reagan to veto any such bill . When asked if there is a rising danger of a worldwide trade war , Baldrige said " Yes , I do n't think there 's any question about that . " Reuter

again next month to review their accord on currency stability , but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth . The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month 's talks seem likely to build on that stability . A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm . But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood , " That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels . That is in fact what has happened since Paris . " Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives . Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals , but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings . The official refused to comment , however , on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year . On February 22 , the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions , given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth . The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks . " I think these changes will strengthen the President 's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora , " said the official , an Administration economic policymaker . " So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives . " But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability . Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention . According to market sources , the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar , and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar . There is no official confirmation that specific bands were set , although the agreement used the term " ranges " , for the first time in an international economic agreement . The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels . Last week , dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark , which had breached 1.86 to the dollar . British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling 's strength . International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers , who will review market performance and their own economic prospects , will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund . The sources said Italy , which refused to join the Paris pact , was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker . Since Paris , there are signs West German growth is slowing , while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing . Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank ( central bank ) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit . A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany . But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank . " If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it , it would no longer be private , " said the official , who asked not to be identified . Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged , but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high , further coordinated action could be on the April agenda .

International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies , an official newspaper said . The Times of Zambia , which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party ( UNIP ) , quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them . President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December , in line with IMF recommendations , but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots . The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances . The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government 's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia 's foreign exchange auction . The central bank 's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January , pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate . The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction , losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months , but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar . Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency 's devaluation once the auctions restart . Reuter

showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April . In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws , a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices . This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year 's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit . Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products . On the other hand , congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade , said the bill ties Reagan 's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers . Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittee 's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects , " but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse . Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was , " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements . You 'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough . You 'll find poeple who think we have n't avoided violating agreements . " In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices . It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy . Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat , insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law . Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill . As an indication of his success , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions . But he added , " Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation . I think we are progressing very well . " The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt , a Missouri Democrat , to force countries such as Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States . The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices , but would not automatically set off retaliation . Rep. Phil Crane , an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader , said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan . Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition . AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress . But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement , " I 'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland . I 'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president . " In writing the bill , the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles . Rep. Ed Jenkins , a Democrat from Georgia , agreed to hold off his fight . He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry , an aide said . Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year . House Speaker Jim Wright , a Texas Democrat , is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition . Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption . For the most part , the trade bill 's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws . The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production . It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence . Congressmen said the change would have required the U.S. International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981 . Reuter

eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in Europe , economists say . But many economists say the system , which holds eight European Community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands , remains in its infancy . Its new currency , the European Currency Unit ( Ecu ) , has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar . And on Wednesday , the long term vision of the Ecu as Europe 's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when Belgium minted the world 's first Ecu coin . But economists say members such as West Germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system 's founding fathers , ex-West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing . Under this phase , originally due to have started two years after the EMS was set up , decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous European Monetary Fund . But members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters . " The basic problem of the EMS is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common , " said one economist who has closely watched the system 's development . The result is that the EC is often divided over policy on third currencies , accentuating what the economists say is the system 's greatest weakness , its vulnerability to a weak dollar . Over the past 18 months , as the U.S. Dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies , the resulting sharp rise of the West German mark severely strained the system . Another frustration has been Britain 's failure to lend the EMS political support by keeping the pound , still a major world currency , outside the system . No change in the British government 's attitude is expected before the country 's next general elections , due by mid-1988 . Meanwhile , the system 's last realignment , the 11th since it was set up , prompted European finance ministers to ask the EC 's highly-secretive Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it . Their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in Belgium early next month . But economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details . They are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change . " Technical measures wo n't be enough to protect the EMS against external factors such as dollar weakness . For that we must take the step forward to the institutional level , " said Leo de Corel of Kredietbank 's economic research department . Economists say the system 's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates . If the dollar resumes its slide the EMS could be in for more turbulence , they predict . REUTER

controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions , a central bank spokesman said . " The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations , in line with deregulation in the banking industry , " he said in a telephone interview . The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday . The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations . It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain 's financial sector , a move triggered by entry into the Community last year . Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation , a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches . Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system 's lending assets . Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas . The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March . Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans . The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation , but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days . Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding , formerly obtainable through deposits , by issuing certificates of deposit , bonds and commercial paper . They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues , while before they had to be converted into deposits . Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies , instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency . The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans , which previously were limited to three times a bank 's capital equity . The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers , in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates . The reserve requirement , which was already in place on normal peseta deposits , was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government 's money supply growth target . A foreign banker said high reserve requirements , which now account for about 30 pct of deposits , placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors . The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation . " The real problem is the freeing of interest rates , " the banker said . " This is going to take a big bite out of profits . " The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days . The chairman of one of Spain 's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year . REUTER

Dilson Funaro said his country 's foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system . Speaking to a business conference he said " It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) . It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries . " " The crisis is not in Brazil , a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds , " he added . Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S. , Europe and Japan to explain Brazil 's decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt , he stressed the country 's commitment to growth . " We need to and will make the effort ( to solve the debt problem ) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing , " he said , adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis . Brazil , whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world , has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems . President Jose Sarney 's government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund , arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession . Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem . " We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis . " To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials . The country was thus targetting a fall in this year 's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986 's 9.5 billion . Domestically , Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986 , the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year .

little impact on U.S. acreage , prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year , according to a report from the Agriculture Department . The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings , 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings , and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings , the report said . The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat , corn , cotton , sorghum and barley . Last year , almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested . " The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small , " the report said . " The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage , " the USDA report said . The 0/92 program , which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment , would be most used by producers in high productio n/high risk areas where cost of production is high , said Keith Collins , director of USDA 's economics analysis staff . " In the heart of the corn belt , you would not get that much participation , " Collins said . USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/ 92 , 1.5 mln acres of corn , 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton . Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat , 180 mln bushels of corn , 20 mln bushels of sorghum , 10 mln bushels of barley , and 500,000 bales of cotton , the report said . " In determining whether to participate , a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered , " according to the analysis . " What you 're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production , " Collins said . For producers with low production costs , that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs , he said . Under these cicumstances , farmers would not want to go along with 0/92 . But for high cost producers , 0/92 would be more attractive . Also , as loan rates get lower , Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program . " I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first , but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments , " Collins said . In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association , USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month .

" significant progress " was being made in trade talks with the United States and a profile of a major deal was emerging . Opening a debate on free trade in the House of Commons , Mulroney said an accord would create thousands of jobs in Canada and bring greater economic prosperity to both countries . Mulroney , who offered few new details of the talks , said that while the negotiations were risky and difficult , " a profile of a major trade deal is now emerging . " In a 50-minute address , Mulroney made an often passionate defense of the initiative that he said would give poorer areas of the country a major economic boost . " B ecause of our trading patterns over a period of decades , we are in the process of building two Canadas one that is rich and promising , one that is under-developed and under-employed , " said Mulr oney . " What we want is to make sure Newfoundlanders and British Columbians and Albertans and others , that they get their chance . They must be given the opportunity to trade their way to prosperity . " Few detials have been released on the trade talks which were launched nearly two years ago between the two nations that are each others most important trading partners . Recent published reports in Canada , quoting senior trade sources , said the countries were close to reaching a trade deal and it will involve eliminating border trariffs and many non-tariff barriers over the next 10 to 12 years . It has been reported a key stumbling block in the talks is a Canadian proposal to find a new way to settle trade disputes , something that would give Canada protection from Washington 's tough trade remedy laws . But Mulroney , sharply critical of protectionist sentiment in the U.S, said Canada was a " fair trader " and denied the government was pursuing the deal to win unfair access to the American market . He said a trade deal must bring benefits to both sides . " We recognize a good deal must be a fair deal , one that is fair to both sides , " Mulroney said . Reuter

Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) challenging Canada 's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports . Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments , Yeutter said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code . Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts , or to retaliate against Canadian goods , a lower-level U.S. trade official said . However , retaliation is an unlikely step , at least initially , that official said . No decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week . Reuter

extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue , government officials said . The unilateral boycott , proposed by Norway 's minority Labour government , gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia . " The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure , but as a step in an international process , " Norway 's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament . Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regi me 's apartheid policies . Sweden , in a similar move last week , promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October . Norway 's boycott , although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers , makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea . Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading , making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships ' final port at the start of a voyage . Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa . They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa . Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s , but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months , trade ministry officials said . The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986 , while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure . "Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway , " Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters . " Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law . " No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa , but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government , " he said . The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law . Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries . Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found . The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week , parliamentarians said . Reuter

showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April . In a move to toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws , a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices . The bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last year 's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit . Generally , the bill 's provisions toughen U.S. enforcement of trade laws . The trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices , such as dumping products in the United States at prices below cost of production . It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence . In writing the bill , the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles . Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out U.S. products . But congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties Reagan 's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers . Bill Frenzel , R-MI. , said the subcommittee 's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects , " but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse . The goal of trade legislation was " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements , " he said . In a key concession made at the urging of Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski , D-IL. , the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices . It also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the U.S. economy . Rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law . Reagan last year blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill 's provisions , but he added , " Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation . I think we are progressing very well . " The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep. Richard Gephardt , D-MO. , to force countries like Japan , South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the U.S. The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices , but would not automatically set off retaliation . Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition . AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress . But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying , " I 'm not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland . I 'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president . " Rep. Ed Jenkins ( D-GA. ) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry , an aide said . Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year . House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas , one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition , last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption .

halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy , Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said . Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries , he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa . Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries ' terms of trade " the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken , " Tesfay said . The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month , when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West . Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements . The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean " several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items , " he said . Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country 's foreign exchange earnings . Adebayo Adedeji , the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa , told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa . He blamed this on high interest rates , debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors . Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion , Adedeji said . He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa 's economic recovery and development , despite Africa 's willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources . The U.N. Program , approved last year , calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years . Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs , with the rest being raised from local resources , but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped . In view of this poor response , he said " it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries , except a few , will be categorised as least developed countries . " At present , 27 of Africa 's 50-odd states are officially listed in this category . REUTER

and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here . " The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level , " a senior dealer at one leading bank said . The dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151.50 yen . Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability . Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities , needed to finance the U.S. Deficit . Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar . Under the Paris accord , Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus . But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said . If no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said . The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord , they added . " Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil 's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scanda l , " said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank . " There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year , " said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi . But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention . Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks . The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday , they said . But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar 's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars . However , First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said " The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March . " Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 , because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings , which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities . U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates , they said . REUTER

points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit , but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend . The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January . It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-J une . The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69 . " It 's got 69 cents written all over it , " one dealer said . Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release . The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March . Banque National de Paris <B NPP.A> senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries . Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow . <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs , down from 2.99 billion in January . But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor . " We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term , " Buttrose said . Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs , and added " Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable ( to the markets ) .

warned Japan and the United States , its main trading partners , that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC 's relations with both countries . EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan 's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets . They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react . The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill . EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart , Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter , outlining the EC 's concerns . The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism . " The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started , as well as on bilateral relations , " it said . Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , it said . In a separate statement on Japan , the EC ministers said they " deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade ( and ) expect Japan to open up its market more . " The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand . Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary . One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop . " It will be back on the table again and again ," the diplomat said . De Clercq , talking to journalists during the meeting , said , " There is a certain nervousness , a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan . " The EC is not satisfied with Japan 's inability to cut its trade surplus , and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers , where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties . But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war , and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research .

U.S. Will be dependent on oil from the middle east into the next century and must take steps to reduce its vulner ability , the New York Times said . The newspaper said the inter-agency government study found a serious oil-dependency problem due to steadily falling domestic production and rising demand for imported oil . The study concluded that by 1995 the U.S. Will be relying on foreign countries for 50 pct of its oil , more than the peak of 48 pct reached in 1977 and far above the 33 pct rate during the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo . The U.S. Now imports about 38 pct of its oil needs , up from 27 pct a year ago , the New York Times said . It said recommendations sent to the White House by Energy Secretary John Harrington include financial incentives to raise domestic oil production by one mln barrels a day from the current 8.4 mln barrels . The newspaper said the administration has placed increased emphasis on stockpiling oil reserves . It said the view now held is that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be tapped in times of shortages , should be increased by 100,000 barrels a day , rather than 35,000 as called for in the 1988 budget . The newspaper said Harrington may propose restoring the depletion allowance to major producers . " The administration also plans to renew its efforts to ...Repeal the windfall profits tax , remove bars to drilling on the outer continental shelf and repeal the law that limits the use of natural gas in industrial and utility boilers , " it added . The New York Times quoted Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma as saying the study greatly underestimated potential U.S. Demand for imported oil in the next decade and overestimated the amount of domestic oil which would be produced .

in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand , but will be not be as large as in the past , Chinese officials and Japanese traders told Reuters . They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy would not allow a return to large-scale imports , which peaked at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982 . An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year , against 7.73 mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985 . Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor harvest and rising domestic demand , but remained below exports , which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985 . " China is short of foreign exchange , " the Shanghai official said . " We cannot rely on imports , even at current low world prices . Only if there is a major disaster will we become a major importer . " A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought , low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and animal consumption . " At current prices , China loses yuan on every tonne of grain it exports , though it earns foreign exchange which it badly needs , " the trader said . The People 's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land , which will reduce the summer grain harvest from last year 's level . The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying enough attention to agriculture , especially grain , making it difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln tonnes against 391 mln in 1986 . " All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest area , especially of corn , sweet potatoes , paddy rice and high-yield cash crops , " it said . It added factory production might have to be reduced to provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight the drought . Since January , the press has devoted much attention to grain , stressing that growth in output is vital to China 's economic and political stability and that prices paid to farmers are too low . Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain production is a key state policy and outlined the measures being taken in their areas to encourage output . The Shanghai official said that in one suburb , 10 pct of the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise agriculture . He said rural industries in other suburbs also set aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70,000 workers available to help farmers . Chu Jinfeng , an official of Fengbing county outside Shanghai , said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits . Pan Huashan , an official of the agricultural department of Zhejiang Province , said rural industry also subsidises grain output in his province . " In addition , we are setting up grain production bases , raising the level of science and technology on the farms and improving the supply of raw materials , roads and other infrastructure , " he said . The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their spare time , or let other family members farm it . In some cases , they lease the land to grain farmers . The China Daily said last month that grain output should reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480 and 500 mln by 2000 . It said growing grain should be made profitable . " The advantages the state promises grain growers actually yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption . Only this will boost enthusiasm , " it said . REUTER

of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) that South Korea 's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules , Trade Ministry officials here said . They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea 's plan to import less from Japan and more from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers . South Korea unveiled the plan in November . It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991 . South Korea 's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45 billion dlrs in 1986 , and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period . The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods , and to exporters to sell more to Japan . The officials said they believed the Japanese action , one step short of filing a suit , was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan . The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit . REUTER

state-owned Grain Marketing Board ( GMB ) will fall by over 65 pct this year , following a prolonged dry spell , agricultural industry sources said . They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year . About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers . Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980 , the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe . While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes , the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes , which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years . The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from 248,000 tonnes last year , and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986 .

U.S. That a U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the U.S. For them to prove their case . " We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact , " Osamu Watanabe , Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 's ( MITI ) Americas and Oceanic Division , told foreign reporters . " The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place , " he said . U.S. Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States . The agreement , signed last September , aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing U.S. Semiconductor firms ' access to the Japanese market . The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the U.S. Side about the pact , Watanabe said . Yukio Honda , director of MITI 's Industrial Electronics Division , denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries . MITI 's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market , Honda said . " The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now , but in contrast U.S. And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices , " Honda said . MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States , he added . The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter , he said . Despite businessmen 's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls , regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results , Watanabe said . " I am optimistic ," he added .

extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue , government officials said . The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia . Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers , the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea . As oil cargoes are often resold after loading , critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa . Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s , but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months , trade ministry officials said . The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986 , while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure .

and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord , foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here . " The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level , " a senior dealer at one leading bank said . The dollar has eased this week , but remains stable at around 151.50 yen . Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability . Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term , but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities , needed to finance the U.S. Deficit . Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly , and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar . Under the Paris accord , Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand , increase imports and cut its trade surplus . But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax , and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , the dealers said . If no such steps are taken , protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow , putting greater downward pressure on the dollar , they said . The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord , they added . " Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook , the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil 's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scanda l , " said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank . " There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year , " said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi . But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention . Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday , and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks . The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday , they said . But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention , saying it may stimulate the dollar 's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars . However , First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said " The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March . " Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 , because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings , which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities . U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates , they said . REUTER

general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy procedures within a week , employers ' organisation labour relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters . Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the employers ' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption of eight weeks of strikes in the sector . The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim court injunction against the employers ' plans for 350 redundancies this year . A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a final ruling on May 7 . Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well take up to two months , but the employers were not prepared simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the chance they would have to start all over again in any case . " We cannot afford not to continue with our plans . The strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business , and further delays would do even more damag e , " Zeebregts said .

For the full year 1986 , the current account , a broad measure of trade performance , was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985 . The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit . Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter .

Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year , covering foreign aid and government pensions , were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries .

For the full year , these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985 .

Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter . Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs , compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter .

agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for exports to developing countries , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said . The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to subsidise export credits in so-called " mixed credits , " the OECD said . The agreement , to be implemented in two stages in July this year and July 1988 , means the minimum aid component in mixed credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct , and to 50 pct for credits covering exports to the world 's least developed nations . Additionally , a new formula will be used for calculating the aid element in mixed credits , to take account of different interest rates in the exporting countries , the 24-nation OECD , which hosted the reform negotiations , said . Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the subsidies , and ending them completely on loans to relatively rich developing countries by July next year . The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To stop competitors , notably France and Japan , using foreign aid to subsidise exports , putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage . OECD officials said the agreement was based on a provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification by member governments . Some governments , including Austria , had linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April , they added . By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too costly for frequent use . " A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been closed today , " a senior U.S. Official here commented . REUTER

chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains , said he would today introduce a bill to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains producers . Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much acreage they planted . He also said his bill would protect program participants from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose above the loan rate . Reuter

company , said in a published interview today that it was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close on of its french refineries . Lee R. Raymond , Exxon 's new president , singled out the possibility of a closure of one of Exxon 's refineries in France during the interview . An Exxon spokeswoman confirmed that Raymond had specifically mentioned refineries in France but said that no specific refinery had been named . She also said that all of Exxon 's opertations were under constant review . Exxon currently has two refineries in France , FOS in the mediterranean with a capcity of 175,000 barrels per day and Port Jerome west of paris with a similar capacity . Petroleum Intelligence Weekly , an influential trade journal , said , in its current issue , that they understood that Exxon was looking at the possibility of refinery closures in Antwerp , Southern France or possibly Italy . Paul Mlotok , oil analyst with Salomon Brothers inc said that with the closures Exxon made in 1986 in Europe and the improvement in the European refining situation , its future profits there should be good . " Exxon and other major oil companies have closed a bunch of refineries in Europe , upgraded the rest and shaken many of the indepedents out of the market . Now with demand for products rising and efficient operations , Exxon should show superior earning s , " Mlotok said . " Just after Royal Dutch <RD> , they are seen as one of the highest grade refiners in Europe , " he added . Industry sources said that the oil companies were likely to feel greater pressure on their operations in Southern Europe where competition from the OPEC countries is increasing as these producers move further into downstream operations . PIW said that refiners in the Mediterranean can expect increased shipments from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC export refineries . PIW said " sales from Libya , Algeria and elsewhere are expected to reclaim markets lost to Italian and other European refiners as a result of the abundance of cheap netback oil last year .

Democrats to target government farm benefits to small and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today . "On balance , this is the best new idea I have seen , " said Rep. Dan Glickman ( D-Kan. ) , Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat , Feedgrains and Soybeans . " This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the ( Reagan ) administration 's farm proposal . " The plan , offered by Reps . Tim Penny ( D-Minn . ) and Byron Dorgan ( D-ND ) , would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs . Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat . The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct , eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits . Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years , protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted . However , Rep. Pat Roberts ( R-Kan . ) said the measure would " involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is . " Roberts said the bill , for example , would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas . Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments . Reuter

foreign exchange auction at the end of this month as part of a new two-tier exchange rate , central bank governor Leonard Chivuno said . Chivuno told a press conference at the end of three weeks of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) that there would be a fixed exchange rate for official transactions and a fluctuating rate , decided by the auction , for other types of business . The Bank of Zambia previously held weekly auctions to distribute foreign exchange to the private sector and determine the kwacha 's exchange rate , but these were suspended at the end of January . President Kenneth Kaunda said at the time that he was suspending the auction system in view of the rapid devaluation and violent fluctations of the exchange rate which had resulted . Business and banking sources said another reason for suspending the auction was that the central bank was low on foreign exchange and was 10 weeks behind in paying successful bidders . The kwacha stood at 2.2 per dollar when the auction system was first introduced in October 1985 , but it slid to around 15 per dollar by the time it was suspended 16 months later . Since then , Zambia has operated a fixed exchange rate of about nine kwacha per dollar . REUTER

producers , announced today , are aimed at encouraging developments in the North Sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry , the Inland Revenue said in a post-budget statement . Earlier , Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson announced in his annual budget to Parliament that from today , companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ) . To date , full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself , when its income stream began , but was not immediately available against other development expenditure , the statement said . The new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today , and will improve the post-tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed , it said . Lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for PRT relief to be offset against PRT liability . This means oil-related expenditure in the U.K. Or on the U.K. Continental shelf , which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred , to be allowed against PRT liability in any oil field , the Inland Revenue said . This brings the scope of PRT relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures , and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs , it said . In due course , the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year , it calculated . The Inland Revenue statement also included other technical measures that Lawson did not comment on in his budget speech . These included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of PRT-exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation . Tidier rules on incorrectly allowed PRT expenditure reliefs were announced , while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and Advance Corporation Tax relating to the so-called " ring fence " of activities in the U.K. And its continental shelf . The Finance Bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in November , it said . Gareth Lewis Davies , a North Sea expert with stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Inc in Edinburgh , thought the two reliefs on PRT would help the depressed offshore industry . He said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller North Sea fields such Osprey , Don and Arbroath would be brought forward . Early development of the larger Miller and Bruce oil fields might also be encouraged , he said . Lewis Davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry , which suffered a huge amount of lay-offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year . He pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the Southern Basin . This means more jobs could be created , as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the North Sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south . He said the PRT relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry , although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year . REUTER

likely to fall by as much as one full point to 9-1/2 pct this week following the sharp three billion stg cut in the U.K. Central government borrowing target to four billion stg set in today 's 1987 budget , bank analysts said . The analysts described Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's budget as cautious , a quality which currency and money markets had already started to reward . Sterling surged on foreign exchange markets and money market interest rates moved sharply lower as news of the budget measures came through , the analysts said . Lloyds merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle said he expected base rates to be cut by one full point tomorrow . " This is very much a safety-first budget in order to get interest rates down , " he said . Bootle said the money markets had almost entirely discounted such a one point cut , with the key three month interbank rate down to 9-11/16 pct from 9-13/16 last night , and it would be rather conservative for banks to go for a half-point cut now . Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds said he , too , expected base rates would be a full point lower by Friday , but this would likely happen via two half-point cuts . " This budget is designed to please both the markets and the electorate . The implications for interest rates are very favourable , we could have a half-point cut tomrorow and another such cut before the end of the week , " Simmonds said . Pointing to buoyant U.K. Retail data released yesterday , he said Lawson had done well to resist pressures for a sharp cut in income tax rates at the expense of a lower borrowing target . " There is no real need to boost private consumption , " he said . National Westminster Bank chief economist David Kern said the lower borrowing target set in the budget had increased the likelihood of an early one-point base rate cut . Kern said the budget would have to be analysed carefully , in particular to see how exactly Lawson planned to achieve the sharper than expected borrowing target cut , before a one-point base rate cut could be implemented . But providing the budget small-print was convincing , " and I suspect it will be , it is entirely possible that we see one point off base rates by the end of this week , " Kern said . Bootle of Lloyds said the expected base rate cut would pave the way for an early one-point cut in mortgage lending rates . This would help achieve Lawson 's lower than expected consumer price inflation target of four pct at end-1987 , he said . U.K. Base rates were cut last week to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct after sustained pressure from the foreign exchange , money and government bonds ( gilts ) markets . But building societies said they would not cut lending rates until base rates had fallen by one full point . REUTER

against European currencies and the yen , and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth , a top Bundesbank official said . Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies " can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective . " He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald " an era of greater exchange rate stabilit y . " The Paris agreement was not , however , an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates , Gleske stressed , adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level . " At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen , " Gleske said . He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada , Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong , and further falls there may still be necessary . But " a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position , as measured by its weighted external value , " he said . In fact , a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers , Gleske said . First , in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany , it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses . Second , in the United States , it could damage investors ' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits , Gleske said . Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies , fluctuating in narrow bands against each other , can be established . Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts , " both within countries and between them . " For instance , the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels , but domestic considerations call for low ones . If target zones were established , this would put " pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more , even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities , " he said . Gleske added , " targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities . " Commenting on the Paris currency accord , Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained . These chances " seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates , and the monetary policies behind them , will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead . " Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot . " He said this " would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible . " Monetary policies can help achieve this , but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments , he said . REUTER

that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000 could have potentially damaging implications for national security . The Energy Department study discusses several options to curb reliance on foreign oil , but makes no recommendations . President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help the depressed domestic oil industry . Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that " although we have made gains in energy security in the last six years , this report shows that there is justification for national concern both over declining competitiveness of our domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports . " The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S. consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct . Among the report 's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration . President Reagan ordered the study last September , citing a determination that the country never again become captive to a foreign oil cartel , referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and sharp prices increases of the 1970s . The report said an import fee would raise prices and help make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new oil , as well as to cut imports , but on the whole the tax would depress the nation 's economy . reuter

" we are looking to a long-term relationship , and at a time of protectionist tendencies in the U.S. Congress there are clear benefits to both sides , " he said . Adams said pdvsa crude would remain competitive even with an oil import fee because champlin had invested heavily over the years in adapingthe texas refinery to process venezuelan heavy crudes with coking and hydro-treating facilities and obtain a competitive product yield . " therefore while the danger of an oil import fee has been a consideration in the negotiations , and it remains to be seen what such a fee would rep r e sent , we do not foresee any impact on today 's agreement , " adams said .

Lawson 's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts , if slightly lacking in exci tement . A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow , with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall . A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week . " Worthy but boring would probably sum it up ," Peter Fellner , U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co , said . " It was a very , very prudent fiscal budget . " Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government 's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat . Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side , but offered nothing new on monetary policy . As was widely expected , Lawson split his " fiscal adjustmen t " between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct . The target for the narrow measure of money supply , M0 , was kept unchangd at two to six pct , while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped . Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow , but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately . Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow . " The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later , " Jeffrey said , though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future . The main worry from today 's speech is the outlook for inflation , given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it , Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said . Holt noted the " rather loose " inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987 , and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern . " A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term , " he said , although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation . The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was " not a good budget for inflation , " he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation . Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the " leading edge " of monetary policy , but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front . He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness . Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts . Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets , which are already discounting that amount , Jeffrey said . that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87 , which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg . But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election , which has to be held before June , 1988 . Some believe it signals a poll this June , noting that the benefits , such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco , become available immediately . But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it . James Capel 's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent , Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no " chickens coming home to roost . " Richard Jeffrey , who favours the likelihood of a June election , said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory . Nevertheless , he said , it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party 's pre-e lection popularity . REUTER

He said also at a news conference that he would recommend to the White House that the fill rate of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be increased from its planned 35,000 barrels per day . The oil reserve fill rate capacity is 100,000 barrels a day . Herrington said he had always advocated a greater fill rate for the petroleum reserve , but the rate had been kept down because of budgetary constraints . Herrington did not disclose what tax incentives he might advocate , but U.S. officials have shown interest in tax benefits for oil and gas exploration and for research and development into new ways to extract oil which is now considered uneconomical to produce . He made the remarks in conjunction with the release of the Energy Department 's study on oil 's impact on national security . Herrington said that before he disclosed what recommendations for tax benefits for the oil and gas industry he might make , he would raise the matter with the White House Economic Policy Committee to see if the proposals to increase oil production made good tax policy .

In a speech to a European Community ( EC )/OAPEC/OPEC seminar in Luxembourg released here , Al-Wattari said " OPEC believes ...The world energy trade should be kept without restrictions and should be built around a fixed average price of 18 dlrs . " But he warned that defense of the 18 dlr a barrel level had caused hardship for OPEC countries , who had been forced to curtail production , and he warned that such cutbacks by OPEC states could not be sustained in some cases . " For OPEC to stabilize the world oil price at what is now considered the optimal level of 18 dlrs a barrel , its member countries have had to undergo severe hardship in curtailing production , " Al-Wattari said . " Such cutbacks Cannot , in certain cases , be sustained , " Al-Wattari said . As well as financial and marketing pressures , some states depended on associated gas output for domestic use and oil cutbacks had left insufficient gas supplies , he added . Al-Wattari noted that total OPEC output was below the organization 's agreed ceiling for all member countries in February , although this had meant sacrifices . The effect of these sacrifices meant that market stability , though restored to a good level , was still under pressure , Al-Wattari said . " A lasting stability in the world market requires a wider scope of international cooperation , " he added . He said some non-OPEC oil producing countries had shown a political willingness after 1986 to cooperate with OPEC . But although cutbacks announced by these states were politically significant and welcomed by OPEC , they were insufficient in terms of volume , he added . " The overall majority of non-OPEC producers have not responded sufficiently to OPEC 's calls for supply regulation , " he said . Al-Wattari said an 18 dlr a barrel price was optimal as it allowed investment in the oil industry outside OPEC to continue , while not generating excessive cash flow for otherwise unviable high-cost areas outside OPEC . Such a price would no longer encourage protectionist measures , he added . Fadhil Al-Chalabi , OPEC Deputy Secretary General , also addressing the semi nar , added that discipline was still needed to prevent violent fluctuations in the oil market . Cooperation between Arab states and Europe was advantageous for both sides , Al-Chalabi said , adding he hoped cooperation would ultimately lead to full-fledged Euro-Arab dialogue . Reuter

details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports caused by earthquake damage , a senior Petroleos de Venezuela ( PDVSA ) official said . " We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be affected , " he said during the signing of a joint venture deal with Union Pacific Corp today . He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by Ecuador 's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite . He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be considered . Venezuela , possibly unique among oil exporters , requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market . Ecuador 's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador 's account and remit the revenues to Quito . Ecuador would pay back the oil at a rate of 35,000 bpd . He said Venezuela 's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean state oil company Cepe , but the PDVSA official said the company never allows third parties to trade its oil . Reuter

statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth , economists said . Building was boosted by two factors last month , unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates . But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy , if any , will come from housing in coming months . And after a steady retreat , mortgage rates seem to be near bottom . U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in January . It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986 . The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January . " February 's weather is usually more adverse for home building . Because of seasonal factors it 's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road , " said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. The housing report is seaso nally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks . As a result , milder temperatures inflate the statistics . Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month . But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer . " Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let 's do it now ', " said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington , whose members supply much of the financing for home building . But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy . He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February . Last November , fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct . As expected , the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector . The multi-family area which typically represents rental units remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1 . S ing le-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units . Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate . " Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job . But we 're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potentia l , " said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . McCarthy noted that the housing report , together with larger than expected gains in U.S. employment , industrial output and retail sales in February , may cause some observers to start waving " four pct GNP banners " for the first quarter . Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter . But McCarthy , who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above , is not convinced that growth will pick up in future . " The big story is the inventory re-building that 's going on now , not all of which is intentional , " he said . For example , U.S. automakers , who are already saddled with high stocks , produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln . Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter , they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second , he said . " If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand , then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter ," agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects . Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed . " At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter , we could foresee production slowing in the second , " cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy , Crisanti and Maffei Inc , who expects first quarter growth of about three pct .

revenues will fall to four billion stg in the fiscal year 1987/88 , from 4.75 billion in 1986/87 and 11.5 billion in 1985/86 . The forecast came in the Treasury 's Financial Statement and Budget Report issued after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's annual budget statement to parliament . The government is assuming the price of oil will average 15 dlrs a barrel , in line with its earlier forecasts , and its oil revenue calculation is based on an exchange rate remaining close to current levels , the Treasury document said . The Treasury said the 1987/88 oil revenue shortfall will reflect the oil price fall of 1986 , as North Sea corporation tax is paid after a time lag . The statement calculated that a one dlr a barrel difference in oil prices this year will change revenue by about 350 mln stg for the current fiscal year , and 400 mln stg in a full year . Oil production is forecast to fall slightly in 1987 , according to the statement . A change in one mln tonnes in production would alter revenue by about 45 mln stg in 1987/88 and 50 mln stg in a full year , it added . Total general government receipts for 1986/87 are now estimated to be 159.2 billion stg , 2.75 billion more than the 1986 Budget forecasts and above the Autumn Statement forecasts , despite a shortfall of 1.25 billlion in oil receipts . Additional non-North Sea corporation tax of 1.75 billion stg and VAT of 750 mln stg account for the bulk of the overshoot . Total general government receipts were forecast to rise to 168.8 billion stg in fiscal 1987/88 , and among the main items , besides diminishing oil revenues , were projected income tax of 40 billion stg , up from 38.4 billion in the current year . Non -North Sea corporation tax is forecast to bring in 13.5 billion stg in 1987/88 , after the revised 11.2 billion in 1986/87 , and VAT revenue should amount to 23.3 billion , compared with upwardly revised estimated 21.5 billion this fiscal year . The general government expenditure for the coming fiscal year is expected to total 173.5 billion stg , up from a revised 164.9 billion in the current year . A repayment of 800 mln on public corporations ' market and overseas borrowings is forecast to bring the total Public Sector Borrowing Requirement down to 3.9 billion stg in 1987/88 , from this year 's revised 4.1 billion , the Treasury said .

approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant . The one-time pilot 0/92 program , designed to assist farmers in Kansas , Oklahoma , Michigan and parts of Missouri , was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate . Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration , the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure . USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration 's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs . The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received . To be eligible , winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring , although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay . USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs , largely because of reduced crop forfeitures . The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall 's flooding . In addition , the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall . Currently , because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds , USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses . The administration said it opposed the bill because , by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief , it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance . USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration 's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings . USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs , while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs , which must be appropriated by Congress . The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs . USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs . In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments . But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program . Reuter

the Commodity Credit Corporation ( CCC ) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1 , 1987 , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August , 1987 . These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year , the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report . Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets , it said . The department said last summer , for example , certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn . This helped increase marketable supplies , so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel somewhat lower than they would have otherwise . The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels , it said . The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986 's 25.8 billion dlrs . During 1988 and 1989 , the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980 's will reverse . If current policy remains in force , annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year 's record by more than eight billion dlrs , it said . The department said the President 's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs . In 1987 , foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct , the same as in 1986 , but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86 , it said . Partially because of this improvement , U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years , the department said . Reuter

The yen 's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon , the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month . But " endaka , " like many Japanese products , is for foreign consumption , locals and long-time foreign residents said . " It 's not really that expensive . I do n't pay attention to the cost of living , " said Cheryl Richmond , a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo . Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by " chatting " 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language . For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny , quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku , one of Tokyo 's prime business and entertainment districts , and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month .

are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting interest rates , banking sources said . They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity on the money market . Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending rates , they said . Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16 but the move has not substantially increased loan demand , the sources said . Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986 . The current gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade . Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about 40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created problems for many banks in managing their money effectively . Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth . The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion in bank deposits . Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have further buoyed the Thai stock market this week . The Securities Exchange of Thailand ( SET ) Index on Monday recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years , shooting up 4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02 . Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market . Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of bank capital . If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry date , many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct . Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht of surplus funds to the local money market . REUTER

" Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures , " said Katsuyuki Okayasu , general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd 's bond division . " But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market ," said Tetsuya Dezuka , deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd , one of the most active yen bond brokers in London . Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there , dealers said . Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140,000 billion yen , with most held in Japan , they said . An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago , enabling a continuous 12-hour session , bond managers here said , adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind . LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan 's Finance Ministry last December . But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets , dealers said . Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen , but the extent of investor linked transactions is unknown , securities bond managers said . " Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London , suggesting they increasingly are engaging in , not only fund raising , but management there , " Dezuka said . The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market 's growth , dealers said . Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year , securities managers said . The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract , they said . The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country . Fundamental Brokers Inc , a major U.S. Brokers ' broker , has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April . CBOT 's start of an evening session , planned for the end of April , will also multiply yen bond futures trading , a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said . But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market . " Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE, " said Koki Chiyojima , deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd 's bond administration division . Nikko Securities Co Ltd , one of the big four Japanese securities houses , is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters . Japan 's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September , or June and December from April 1 , matching futures delivery months . The ministry now pays coupons in January , June , July and December . When delivery months and coupon payments do not match , a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-r esident bond holders , a deterrent to LIFFE , securities managers said . LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen , bond managers said . These bonds will be used for deliveries , as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates , they said . Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues , making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987 .

an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg . Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market . Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today , possibly of one point , following yesterday 's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg . Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers ' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively . Partly offsetting these outflows , exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today . REUTER

said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today 's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct . However , he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates , although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly . He told a briefing of economic journalists that " I do n't think we should rush anything . " Lawson stressed the themes of " gradualism and steadiness " as economic policy . Lawson acknowledged that today 's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88 , unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement ( PSB R ) of 1.0 pct of GDP . Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates , both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines , were " perfectly consistent " with monetary conditions now in Britain . He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was " safely inside " its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88 . In his budget , Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3 . Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System ( EMS ) , Lawson repeated that " it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election . " He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review . But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. E c on omy . But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls . Although Lawson denounced what he said was " the current wave of election fever " in Britain , he added " It is more likely that there will be an election this year " than not . He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air . " Ideally , we ( the government ) should have a full term , " but events could force a premature poll , Lawson said . The government , which has been in power since 1979 , must call an election by June 1988 . Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election , political sources said . The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 " was the right balance , economically and politically , " he said . Lawson 's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts , who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move . But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which , while advancing towards that aim , could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate . Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 by some three billion stg . Returning to changing levels of interest rates , Lawson stressed that "they are not an objective ( for the government ) they are an instrument of policy . " Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels , he said . But "there may be interest rate consequences " from changes in the level of government borrowing , he added . Lawson said he did not think that the U.K. 's relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain . He said conditions created by London 's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries . Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain , Lawson said . First , control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone , due to the freedom of its financial markets . He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party . Thirdly , he said " we do not have as long a track record of low inflation " as did the U.S. , Japan and West Germany . Lawson foresaw London becoming the world 's pre-eminent financial centre , because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo . REUTER

rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988 , the Institute of Economic Research ( NZIER ) said . The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product ( GDP ) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December . Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter . The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87 . The government 's tight fiscal position is not expected to change , it said . Annual inflation , measured by the consumer price index , is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986 , it said . " Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates real interest rates are also expected to ease ( albeit slightly ) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital , falls away , " the NZIER said . Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter , but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct . Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct . Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct . The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and , by next March , reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank 's trade weighted index , which is based on a basket of currencies . The index now stands at around 66.4 . " A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast , " the NZIER said . " The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88 . " The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86 . The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86 . This compares with the government 's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion . " Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation , " the NZIER said . " O verall , these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and , if they continue to be improved upon , bode well for future prospects . " REUTER

steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow 's regular central bank council meeting , bank economists and dealers said . " There is no need for action , " Hermann Remsperger , chief economist of Berliner Handels and Frankfurter Bank ( BHF ) said . Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month 's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone , so a change in credit policies could be ruled out . One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed . Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact . But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit . Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates . Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February , unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January . Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates . But Poehl played down the risk of inflation . Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success . Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year . " The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing , " one economist said . He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds . This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels , money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term . These developments were increasing the Bundesbank 's scope for a rate cut in the medium-term , economists said . Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed , indicating no change in credit policy was expected . Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday , with the market well stocked with liquidity . Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far . But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month 's major tax payment period is felt . Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market . The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week , but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks . Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80 . One dealer said , " If the central bank wanted lower interest rates , it would first of all drive call money rates down . " Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets . They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday , averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March . A requirement of around 51 billion is expected . REUTER

will cut oil production to 420,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) from May 1 , trade sources said . Malaysia cut its 510,000 bpd target output by 10 pct last September to support Opec moves to boost prices , and the latest cut would reduce output by 17.5 pct from 1986 's target level . Petronas said in February that Malaysia would maintain its 10 pct production cutback until mid-198 7 . However , the Finance Ministry said in its annual report that Malaysia 's crude oil output was expected to rise to an average 510,000 bpd in 1987 . The ministry 's forecast assumed average 1987 crude prices at 13 dlrs/barrel ( bbl ) , but prices have risen enough to permit further production cutbacks , the sources said . Malaysia 's benchmark Tapis blend fetched above 18 dlrs/bbl this year against a low of 10.50 dlrs/bbl in July , they said . Traders said further reductions by Malaysia would add to the tight spot availabilities of Asian grades caused by reduced Indonesian and Chinese crude output . The cutback will also help Malaysia maintain prices , as there is concern some buyers want to reduce term purchases due to the availability of cheaper alternatives , the sources said . In addition to term sales , Petronas has been offering two to three 400,000 bbl spot cargoes of Malaysian crude each month for sale through tender , the sources said .

cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates , banking sources said . The cuts follow nearly two months after the Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates , far longer than the usual interim period . A Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis by 0.5 percentage points to two pct . Dresdner Bank AG <DRSD.F> and Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves . Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG <BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally . The delay was partly due to commercial banks ' desire to gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings banks . A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could reduce cheap refinancing available to banks , forcing them to draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources , one economist at the German Banking Association said . But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest them at higher yields in the future , he said . He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money supply aggregate . The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5 pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year , unchanged from January . The growth rate was outside the expanded target range of three to six pct . Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private customers , though lending rates for corporate customers are beginning to decline . REUTER

Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England 's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance , but financial markets appear set to force its hand , analysts said . They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant . Earlier , markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday 's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg . Sterling money market rates moved lower again , with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/1 6 yesterday , and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading . Government bond prices also surged on the budget , with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year . But today 's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now , analysts said . Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt . Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary , and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow , leading to higher gilt prices , exchange rate advances and lower money market rates . " Today 's cut was slightly disappointing , " said Bill Martin , chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew . " The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line To temper the markets ' first rush of blood to the head after the budget . " Analysts said the bank 's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time . The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term . Sharp rises in the pound 's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again . " The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being , " said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simm onds . " But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long . " Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs , forcing a rate cut by Friday . Robin Marshall , chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities , said " There is another half point to come in the near term , this week or next week at the latest ...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks . " Analysts stressed that apart from prestige , Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling 's exchange rate . Martin , of Phillips and D rew , said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately . Analysts said the budget , featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances , had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date . One must be held before June , 1988 . Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. E c on omy , this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets , pushing the pound 's value well above unofficial targets . With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook , Chase's Marshall said " Sterling is simply the best game in town , especially after the budget , and demand will remain strong .

plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers , industry sources told Reuters . The salvage measures , which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program , are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan , the world leader , has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages , they said . The sources said South Korea 's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan 's due to such factors . The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June , the sources said . They said from September a semi -government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity , and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment . Last Friday , the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1 . The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month , the sources said . A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness , they said . Under the cartel proposals , 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes ( CGRT ) in 1987/88 . This is about half of total capacity . This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost , the sources said . The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88 , they said . The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to 30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 . Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December , followed by South Korea and Taiwan , according to Lloyd 's Register of Shipping . However , falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry , the sources said . Four of Japan 's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7 , they said . The shipbuilding companies ' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years , the sources said .

six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) have ended talks after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at boosting economic integration . But the ministers from Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) did not endorse a resolution on a common currency exchange rate system . The UA E 's Minister of State for Finance and Industry , Ahmed Humaid al-T ayer , told reporters after the two-day talks that the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank governors for further discussion . He said the governors , who agreed in January on a proposed denominator on which the six currencies should be based , were asked to resubmit the recommendation before July , when finance ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia . Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to discuss the issue , adding there was a possibility that a new system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year . The denominator approved by the governors has not been made public , but banking sources said it could be similar to the European Monetary System ( EMS ) . Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state . They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms . He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods containing radiation caused by last year 's Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union , and agreed all products with excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin .

"As part of this study , I think the Administration will take the fill rate under review , " Herrington said at a House Energy subcommittee hearing . The Administration has proposed cutting the fill rate from 75,000 barrels of oil per day to 35,000 bpd in fiscal year 1988 to save money . " My personal feeling is that is too low .

Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels , cash grain dealers said . Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior which a dealer in Davenport , Iowa , said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain . By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn , the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales , where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed . If the USDA acts soon , as many dealers expect , the movement would break the Gulf corn basis . " The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices , " one dealer said . " It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City , " which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest . " But we do n't know when they might do it , " an Ohio dealer said , which has created uncertainty in the market . The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage . Yesterday , USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers ( in lieu of cash payme nts ) had to date been exchanged for grain . With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months , the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices , cash grain dealers said . A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals , cash dealers said . Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price . The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight , dealers noted . The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels , squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings , they said . " The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports , " which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn , one Midwest cash grain trader said . But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside , freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system . Reuter

said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year . The institute , whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes , said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986 , and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn . The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product ( G NP ) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real , seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year . The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters , it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct . Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct . In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development , with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak . DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods , and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods , not between foreign and domestic demand . It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports , which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans . Service industries , unlike manufacturing industry , were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand , it said . In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany 's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year . However , the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986 's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986 , it said .

a tax break for the oil industry would undergo review .

But Fitzwater noted that Reagan did have a fundamental objection to tax rises and special tax breaks . He said that even though Herrington 's recommendation did not agree with existing policy , " We 'll take a look at it . " The review will be undertaken by the president 's Domestic Policy Council .

" It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review .

He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes .

Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today 's Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance .

last year are rapidly deflating the United State 's natural gas bubble , which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch , industry analysts said . Faltering deliverability of natural gas , a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities , could more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990 , some analysts said . The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico 's offshore waters where some of the nation 's largest gas reserves are located . " We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent , " said James Crandall , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. "Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they 're betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two . " The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year 's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that . Today 's relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages . The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count , a barometer of the oil industry 's health , showed 761 U.S. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year . In 1986 , the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times . Ike Kerridge , a Hughes economist , said " In 1986 , the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate wo n't be any better this year . " He added , " We do n't have the options we do with oil . Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost . " Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet , according to industry estimates . George Gaspar , an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling . " We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies . That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988 , " Gaspar said . Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989 . Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico , where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years . Some of the industry 's biggest companies , such as Exxon Corp <XON> , Mobil Corp MOB , and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico , Crandall said . For example , Conoco Inc , a Dupont <DD> subsidiary , will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico 's deepest production plat form , which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day . But T. Boone Pickens , who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in recent months , is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery . Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do . " The rigs wo n't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barre l , " said Pickens , 58 , adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. Tenneco Inc <TGT> , one of the largest U.S. gas producers , is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists . Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years ' supply . Current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement , he said . Reuter

warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S. trading partners . The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman , head of the EC delegation in Washington , to Dan Rostenkowski , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee . A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters . Denman told Rostenkowski , an Illinois Democrat , he backed aspects of the bill , such as one backing new talks under the GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry . But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices . Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved . He said " If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory , then the United States would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners . " Denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws , saying " in the last resort , any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest . " Otherwise , he said , " the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the United States , i.e. , retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the United States . " Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims . Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms . " Changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally . They cannot be imposed by the United States alone on the world trading system , " he said . House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing , similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by President Reagan . There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment . Reuter

have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs , the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said . Implementation of a 0/92 program , a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates , and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending , said Dan Glickman , D-Kans. , chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat , soybeans and feedgrains . Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association , Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved . Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget , Glickman added . Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA 's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year . " The administration 's target price proposals are dead in the water , " he said . To cut the budget , Glickman said , " everthing is on the tabl e , " except those moves that would reduce farmers ' income . Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending . Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman , which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year . Tightening up on the use of generic ( in-kind , or " pik ' ) certificates will also be another option his committee will study , Glickman said . While not committing himself for or against such action , he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments . Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs . He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs , but added that he would not be in favor of such a change . Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program 's , EEP , spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up , and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas . Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely , he said . " I do n't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block , " Glickman said . Reuter

better health than it was a year ago , according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today . The Commission , which regulates the state 's oil and gas industry , heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out . " The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic ( than last year ) ," Commissioner James E. ( Jim ) Nugent told Reuters . " It reflects their ( the executives ) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle , " he added , " and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again . " The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices , which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-198 6 . Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel . At the same time , a number of company executives testified that the nation 's domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help . Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations . Currently , there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985 . Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy , many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand , was leading to a growing dependency on imports , particularly from the politically volatile Middle East . " In the U.S. , 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices , increasing about 2.5 pct , or 400,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) ," said J.S. Simon , General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp <XON> , the nation 's largest oil company . At the same time , Simon said " U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd , the first decline in several years ," and " net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd . " Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel , depending on OPEC 's ability to control production , Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels , leading to " a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity , in excess of 10 mln bpd . " He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for " governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry . " Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and " Superfund " legislation , Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax , total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration . Simon did not mention an oil import fee , which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation 's domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised . In yesterday 's report , the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995 , adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world 's total oil consumption by that date . Arguing that " oil is a political tool in every nation on earth , " Frank Pitts , chairman of <Pitts Oil Co> , today called for a variable oil import fee , among other measures , " before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised . " Royce Wisenbaker , Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co , agreed , saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions , it would probably turn into a " shambles . " Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future . " For those of us who have managed to hold on , the worst is over , " he said . Roger Hemminghaus , President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co , said he was " enthusiastic about the future , " adding that he expected " an increase in profitability by midyear .

expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year , up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986 , the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting . It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989 . The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro . New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project . The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year , 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England , the utility said . New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987 . The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year , adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total . New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock . Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well . The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future , but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans . President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years . However , the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth , he said , pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years . He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy . Huntington said New England Elecetric has " all but rejected new coal fired plants " to supply additional power . He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules . Later , vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired , combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs , but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units . He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units , adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal . Reuter

Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974 , rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982 . In its annual report , pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day , 202,000 bpd down on 1985 . Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd , down from 1.44 mln bpd . The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil , but has previouly said it was about 48 pct . Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day , down from 3.6 billion in 1985 . Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year , 58 wells , both exploratory and production , were suspended , 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production .

of Exxon Corp <XON> , said it had no immediate plans to shut down one of its two refineries . Exxon 's new president Lee R. Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French refinery . An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that depended on the evolution of the market and refineries ' ability to make money . He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses . The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer 's is five mln , the spokesman added . Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery , while the Port Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant . Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that Exxon was reviewing its worldwide refinery operations and might decide to close one of its French refineries . Reuter

lines , regarded as vital to ensure smooth foreign commercial transactions , have more than doubled to 430 mln dollars under the 20-month government of president Alan Garcia . Central bank general manager Hector Neyra told reporters many of the credits were 90-day . Trade credits were 210 mln dlrs when Garcia took office in 1985 announcing a tough stance limiting foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings . Neyra told Reuters Peru was current on interest payments on short-term debt , including trade credit lines and on about 750 mln dlrs in so-called " working capital " credits . Trade credit lines were 880 mln dlrs in 1982 , but fell in 1984 when Peru stopped some payments to private foreign banks . Reuter

are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry , hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices , and the subsequent growth in oil imports , industry analysts said . " The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better , " said Daniel Yergin , director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues . Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee . Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed . Herrington said , " I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day ( addition ) to U.S. production . " U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13 , down six pct from last year , the American Petroleum Institute said . Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term . Paul Mlotok , oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that " even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we 've only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year . " Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration . John Lichtblau , president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said " The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario . But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy . " Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time . " Lowering the producing industry 's tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant ( to output ) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs . " Lichtblau said . But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee . Ronald Tappmeyer , president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors , said , " The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation . " The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies . The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle . Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congres sman , Orval Hansen , showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry . At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests . But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise . Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements " is a critical , symbolic level . If they ( imports ) move above that level , a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action . " But Lichtblau , in a telephone interview , said , " a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990 . In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u .s . energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987 , he added . Reuter

Department 's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow , Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market . " If we are going to sell our products , whatever they may be , wheat or anything else , then we have to meet the market ," Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers . " We have to be competitive . It 's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else . They just aren't , " he said . " That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets , and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better , " Shultz told the Wheat Growers . Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife , he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced . Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices . Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced . Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue . Reuter

their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes , versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February . But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year 's total of 7.1 mln tonnes , according to official figures , and would be a new record . The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year . The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province . The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty , especially in Cordoba . Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops , since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas . Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province , totalling between one and 10 mm . There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces . With clear skies and seasonable temperatures , fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks , allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize , sunflower and sorghum harvesting . Crops were considered in generally good condition , though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage . The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted , compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago . Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares , down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes , versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago . The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest , according to official figures . The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area , versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago . Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares , or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest . The current harvest 's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes , or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest 's record 4.1 mln tonnes . Yields varied widely from area to area , and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and , consequently , on total production volume . The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area , compared to four to six pct a week ago . Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares , or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest . Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week , or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest 's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes . Reuter

that U.S. interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week . " We got a little volatility Wednesday , " said Staley Commodities International analyst Jerome Lacey . " But for the moment we 're still in a trading range . " Even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the U.S. economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state , the analysts said . " It ( the bond market ) has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility , " said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Denis Karnosky . " It needs something , but it 's not going to be news about the economy ," he said . Karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the Federal Reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy . But even Wednesday , when fed funds were below six pct , the dollar strong and oil on the soft side , bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs , he said . In addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy , Golden Gate Futures president Norman Quinn said the beginning of April could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace . " The market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in Japan on April 1 , " Quinn said . Quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested . If Japanese investment in U.S. securities does materialize at the start of Japan 's fiscal year , domestic funds may also flow into the bond market , he said . " We could get a stiff rally , possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7-1/8 pct , " compared to the current yield of about 7.5 pct , Quinn said . In the meantime , even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures . The Treasury 's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late Wednesday after the close of futures .

ease government controls on exports as several House committees moved rapidly toward approval of major changes in trade laws they hope will help solve U.S. trade woes . The House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on International Economic Policy voted to direct the administration to cut the list of controlled exports by 40 per cent by removing items no longer considered important to U.S. military security . Industries had complained they were losing sales to foreign competitors who were allowed to export freely products U.S. companies could not sell abroad . The issue has been the subject of administration debate . The Commerce Department had held that unnecessary restrictions impeded U.S. exports while the Defense Department said current controls should be retained but better administered . Four congressional panels met today to consider portions of a wideranging trade bill that intends to help U.S. companies sell more products abroad and to fight unfair foreign trade practices . Their separate proposals , some of them conflicting , will be woven by House Democratic leaders into a final trade bill for a vote by the full House in late April . Sparked by the proposal of Fujitsu Ltd. to take controlling interest in Schlumberger Ltd 's Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. , the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Commerce voted to expand Reagan 's authority to block foreign takeovers of U.S. companies . Reagan would be able to block any takeover found to be damaging to U.S. economic or national security interests . " We are losing our semiconductors which are at the heart of our national security , " subcommittee chairman James Florio , a New Jersey Democrat said . The subcommittee also called for the administration to consider retaliation against Japan for its restrictive government procurement practices . The retaliation could be triggered by a requirement that the administration investigate whether U.S. companies were treated unfairly and whether they have been barred from bids on lucrative public works projects such as the eight billion dlr Kansai airport construction . U.S. firms have complained they were not allowed to bid on its construction . At the urging of the U.S. recording industry , the subcommittee agreed to bar imports of a new Japanese product--digital audio recorders . Meeting in closed session , the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to allow President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that refuse to open their markets to U.S. telecommunications products . Congressional aides said the committee also agreed U.S. companies would be allowed to press for relief from imports of counterfeit products made in violation of U.S. copyright and patent laws .

and Transportation are close to agreement on how to fund the increasing share of food aid to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference . Melvin Sims , USDA 's general sales manager told a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee hearing that the two departments are negotiating a " memorandum of understanding " on cargo preference . Under a 1985 farm bill provision , the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. flag vessels was to gradually increase over three years to 75 pct in 1988 . The increased cost of using U.S. vessels was to be funded by the Transportation Department instead of USDA. However , USDA officials said Transportation has so far contributed no money . The agreement between USDA and Transportation is expected to resolve the matter , USDA officials said . Tom Kay , administrator of the USDA 's Foreign Agricultural Service said yesterday the requirement that more food aid shipments be carried on U.S. vessels has been difficult to meet . "As the tonnage ( required under cargo preference ) goes up , its going to be harder and harder to meet , " Kay said . Two farm state Congressmen , Pat Roberts ( R-Kan . ) and Glenn English ( D-Okla . ) said cargo preference makes U.S. farm export programs more costly and the program should be eliminated . In the past , farm interests opposed to cargo preference have been defeated in Congress by the maritime interests who view cargo preference as vital to the U.S. shipping fleet . Reuter

Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party , and party leaders , with an eye to general elections to be held by September , have rejected his calls for a managed float .

the growth in Australia 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data , private economists polled by Reuters said . Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 , after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier . Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending , they said . Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter , while imports rose only 2.9 pct , Statistics Bureau figures show . Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2 . Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government 's aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working . However , he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments . Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven . But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics . The economists ' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra . Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit , notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports . A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages , prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia 's competitiveness , he said . " It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern , " he added .

new realism ushered in by austerity , could lift Saudi Arabia 's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits , bankers and diplomats said . The months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector . Economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct , the first rise since 1982 . But the economists said this will be possible only if the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) succeeds in defending world oil prices and if Saudi Arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long . Saudi Arabia is now keeping production down to defend OPEC 's newly-established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price . Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day ( bpd ) , well down on Saudi Arabia 's OPEC quota of 4.13 mln set for the first half of 1987 . King Fahd has stamped his personal authority on OPEC 's new-found determination to defend prices in a move Western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom 's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy . Saudi Arabia , still the world 's largest oil exporter , is a hugely wealthy country . But the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll . Economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8.6 pct in 1985 . Oil revenue last year , when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel , probably totalled no more than 17.5 billion dlrs , compared to a peak 101.8 billion in 1981 . " Austerity is still the watchword , but Saudi Arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession The Saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects , " a diplomat said . In the short-term , the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves , still put at around 100 billion dlrs . But such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely . Bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term . It also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy . Bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to " tough it out " on the oil front even if that means a short-term depletion of reserves . The 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52.7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay . The budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out . Commerce Minister Suleiman Abdulaziz al-Salim told Saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year . " It therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy ," he said . Reserves were built up during the late 1970 's and early 1980 's when Saudi Arabia 's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary . The shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the Kingdom 's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom . Modern techniques of cost control have been introduced , markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back . The expatriate workforce has fallen sharply . The number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but Saudi banks , hit hard by non-performing loans to the corporate sector , have become highly selective in extending new credit . Government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation 's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment . Private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit . As Saudi Arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector , one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad .

Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States , MITI officials said . The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets . Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1 . The pact , agreed last year , calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus . MITI , anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement , has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export . Last month , the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct . To meet that request , they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter . If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June , second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year . MITI officials , who declined to be identified , said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback . One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there are picking up . MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact . REUTER

consumption are to appear in February data released today , but the bond market 's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected , economists said . Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct , compared with no change in January , while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct , reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January . M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released . An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected . Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income , led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February . Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February , the average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts , he noted in a report . Vigorous spending on durable goods last month , especially cars , foreshadow a rise of at least 1.5 pct in consumption , he added . The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday , with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct . Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range , desperately seeking direction . " Seasonally adjusted , it 's already December in the bond market ," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct , despite some signs of a stronger economy , probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued . But he warned that this assumption might not be justified . " It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits , and now that it has learned that lesson , it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead , " Boltz said in a report . After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct , Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16 , six pct . Reuter

as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa , appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents , dealers and bank economists said . The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents , due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6 , they added . It has risen about two cents this week alone . " Another factor is that banks in London , where the main market is based , are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future , " one economist said . Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains . After reaching 30 cents , " There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks , " one dealer said . There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand , holding stable at 48 cents , and the financial rand were staying firm , banking sources said . A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said " The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment oversea s . " One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand 's rise . Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa 's long-term government bonds and " semi-gilts " or securities in partly government-owned firms , many with yields as high as 30 pct . They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands . " This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand , " a dealer said , adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply . The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country . REUTER

of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world , and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies . Results of the study , which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries , were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified . The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent , PSE. The study shows that on dairy products Japan 's PSE , or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage , averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81 , with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct . For wheat Japan 's PSE averaged 95.8 pct , the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2 . Japan 's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct , the OECD calculations show . In coarse grains , Japan 's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan 's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S. , OECD concluded . For sugar , Japan 's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. , the study shows . The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada , Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S. , EC and Japan , the sources said . Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil , two major developing country producers of commodities , were not included in the OECD work . Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon , perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May . Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva . British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture . He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels , which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture . However , the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers , officials familiar with the study said . The U.S. Agriculture Department 's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84 . In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD 's , in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81 , U.S. officials said . For example , the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 , at 25 to 49 pct , than in the EC , at zero to nine pct . French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale , citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn , told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC . However , the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984 . Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels , a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation . The updated calculations , which may take several months to complete , are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry . U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill , which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice , officials added .

Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a year . The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and the national security the Energy Department sent to the White House on Tuesday .

taking Panamax vessels on timecharter , mainly from the U.S. To carry grain , is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange ( BIFFEX ) , dealers said . Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985 . However , the market tends to be nervous , with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index , which is calculated on spot physical rates . No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage ( about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw ) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan , dealers said . " It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its ( the Soviet ) grain harvest than reported , " one said . Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions , with very few , if any , Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf . Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month . Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand . Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year , they said . They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract , despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year . Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks . Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices , which had supported the market at the start of the year , faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest . Reuter

Korea is expected to widen this year , despite some economic and currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries , economists said . " The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in 1986 will get bigger . This time next year , the U.S. will be screaming at those countries about their exports , " said Steve Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S. after Japan and Canada , while Korea is the seventh largest . Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress , the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric against Taiwan and Korea , urging those countries to allow their currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade . The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized countries ( NICs ) amid signs the dollar 's steep drop against the currencies of Japan and most EC nations previously the main focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap is beginning to close the competiveness gap for American goods . U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he expects a reduction in Japan 's trade surplus this year . But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea , whose currencies have not risen as much as the yen and the mark . As major beneficiaries of soft oil prices and with low labor costs , Taiwanese and Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack . " In 1986 , the fashionable comment in Washington was Japan-bashing . Now it 's NIC-bashing , " said Robert Chandross , of Lloyds Bank PLC . Asia 's four main NICs Hong Kong , South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170 billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986 . The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in 1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985 , while the bilateral trade deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion . And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is continuing . The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6 billion dlrs in January , up 24.4 pct from a year earlier . The gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs , up 24.8 pct from a year ago . Lately both nations have said they will take steps to defuse incipient trade tensions . Korea said it is choosing many of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation . Still , South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt . For its part , Taiwan said in January that it will cut tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and try to diversify exports . But vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect Taiwan 's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987 . The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles and electronic goods . But Korea is raising its profile in the area of " big-ticket " manufactured goods , notably cars . Korea expects its auto exports mostly for North America to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985 . " The NICs ' exports are almost all manufactured goods . When their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing base . It cuts directly to us and to our customers , " said Bob Wendt , manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp. The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea 's computer products exports , 72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its telecommunications equipment . A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S. While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the U.S. , these are offset by their deficits with other countries . But Taiwan and , to a lesser extent , South Korea , stand in marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade and current account surpluses , the Morgan study says . Morgan expects Taiwan 's overall trade surplus to grow to 18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year , and Korea 's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion . Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S. " A lot of Korea and Taiwan 's exports to the U.S. have been at Japan 's expense , " said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp. February 's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies . But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and , in any case , will only work with a sizeable lag , economists say . The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan 's and Korea 's currencies should climb . The Taiwan dollar , which is pegged to the U.S. dollar , has risen about 15 pct since September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct . But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct , economists say . " We 've not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes , " said Bethlehem Steel 's Wendt . And so far , U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect . Moreover , it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will get given the administration 's free-trade stance . " It 's hard to see that anything will be passed much before year-end . And then the question is , will it have teeth ? " one economist said . Reuter

On the grounds of increasing production , he said , " I would rule out a gasoline tax .

expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986 , though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same , Chief executive David Walker said . He told reporters following the release of the company 's 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels . U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln . Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985 . Earlier , Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985 , before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company 's U.S. Assets . The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night 's close . Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well . Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained , the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year . He added that the firmness of oil prices in March , when they were normally weaker , made him " a bit encouraged " about the prospects for future levels . Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel . Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April . End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously . However , Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves . If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines , the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously . Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 billion .

in the year to end-September 1988 , despite last October 's landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the waterway , Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said . He told a press conference that in confirming the Commission 's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988 , he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989 . The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in the current financial year but this could be carried over and met from next year 's revenues . This year 's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost the canal about 15 mln dlrs , McAuliffe said . This included eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further landslides . He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any threat to the canal 's water supply in the foreseeable future . Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard cut would not be affected by the landslide , he said , adding that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest .

Banks said in a financial survey that domestic interest rates would continue to remain low for the time being . It said the Bundesbank could hold them down despite strong foreign influence and it saw no interest-straining factors in the economy that could affect the long-term capital market . The inflation rate of one pct also gave no occasion for higher nominal interest rates . But a probable rise in inflation late this year could give very slight grounds for a rise in nominal rates at year 's end and next year , it said . The association said generally low interest rates , prospects of lower taxes , a stable dollar rate and expected strong domestic demand led it to believe that the investment climate would remain friendly and the economy would continue its slow but very sure growth . The Bundesbank had managed successfully to keep interest rates down on the short-term money market although its policies had exerted little effect on the long-term capital market , which was so important for investment financing and thus for the course of the economy , it said . In view of the limits to the possibilities monetary policy had in influencing the longer-term capital market , the association saw little sense in wanting to boost the economy through a short-term and expansionist monetary policy . On the other hand it also saw no reason for sticking dogmatically to the money supply target for the whole of 1987 . The association said time would show to what extent speculative foreign money and short-term invested domestic money would distort money supply developments . The Bundesbank could hold down money market rates with the highly effective instrument of sale and repurchase transactions , it said . Reuter

narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling 's value requires such a move , economic analysts said . M0 , the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday , fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February . On an annual basis , this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct , in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct . " The M0 data are much better than we expected , " said Robert Thomas , economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities . He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut , they removed an obstacle to such a move . Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February , advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January . Analysts said the M0 measure , reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects , was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates . " The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important In practice , it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tun e , " Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment . Richard Jeffrey , economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett , said in a comment " It is unlikely that ( Lawson ) will respond to signals from M0 alone Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken . " " With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable , the City has been forced to take it seriously , " he added . Noting this point , Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared . This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets , analysts said . Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month , they added . U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement , once on March 11 , and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget . They stand at 10 pct now , and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week . Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3 , which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct , well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct . Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed , but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31 . Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target , and Lawson 's move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy .

of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market levels , U.S. grain trade industry officials said . They said that Shultz 's comments , while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR , were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action . In response to a query on what the State Department 's position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow , Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade . The Soviet Union , the world 's largest grain importer , has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year , complaining the price was far above world market levels . A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program , EEP , was also rebuffed due to the price . Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union , grain industry sources said . Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions . Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel , while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs . " I 'm not sure this is an about-face , but it 's clearly a recognition that unless we 're competitive , we wo n't sell to the Soviet Union , " said a lobbyst for a major commodity group . " We have to be competitive . It 's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else , " Shultz told the farm leaders . " That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets , " he said . If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP , it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow , an industry lobbyst said . National Wheat Grower 's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary 's comments . "His comments were not discouraging , but they did n't in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP, " an official with the wheat group said . The Wheat Growers official noted , however , that "there is significance in that fact that we have n't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets . " In a meeting with exporters this week , Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , the officials said . An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets , said that the Shultz comments " are consistent with what he ( Shultz ) has taught for years as an economist , " but said they do n't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union . Amstutz could not be reached for comment , and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz 's statements . But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow . " If he did n't say no , then there 's a chance . This is potentially a positive development , " a commodity source said . Reuter

decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize , Commission sources said . They said the tax , which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike , would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia . The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority 's cereals management committee today . The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries . The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them . The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize . The request will be considered at the committee 's next meeting , the commission sources said . Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year , while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years .

Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ) announced by U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson this week will favour smaller non-PRT paying fields , according to stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co. The cross field allowance offsets up to 10 pct of qualifying spending on a new oil field against PRT liability of other fields . It is restricted to new offshore developments outside the southern basin and yet to gain Annex B approval . A report by the stockbrokers said that on a new field not paying PRT due to its small size , the relief would directly benefit in PRT saving on an existing field . " The cross field allowance will mainly benefit participators in those fields which have no PRT liability , " the report said , adding that the timing of development of such fields may be advanced . The government would in effect be subsidising these developments at 7.5 pct of capital expenditure before corporation tax , the report said . On fields likely to pay PRT in the future , the benefit is of timing . Although liabilities on other existing fields will be reduced immediately , liabilities on larger new fields will rise in the future due to the loss of offsets , it said . In a study on probable fields , the report said that when the rates of return are examined , the rise for a PRT-paying field such as Miller , the largest undeveloped oil field in the U.K. North Sea , is from 18.7 to 19 pct , while the rise for a small non-PRT paying field such as Kittiwake is 15.9 to 17.9 pct . The report added that in fields which pay PRT , there will be a cost in being able to have this early relief . Not only will these costs be unavailable for offset against the field 's future profits , but uplift of some 35 pct on these costs will be lost . Thus , a saving of PRT of 100 when field development starts will have to be matched by a rise in PRT of 135 at a later time . Reuter

the president 's council of economic advisors , said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines . " Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation , " he told the Futures Industry Association . Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period . " Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery , " he said . Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners , he said recent figures showed Japan 's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 , " Not enough to sustain employment growth . " However , Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies , including tax reform . " I suspect there will be further moves , " he said . Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases . " Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform , " he said , adding that " a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform . " Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated . However , he said that " sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable , " as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad . " I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 , " he said . Improvements in the U.S. trade balance , he said , will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present " serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners . " Western Europe , where manufactures output and employment have been weak , promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance , Sprinkel said . He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them . Reuter

controls should be " gradual " but also " reasonably rapid , " a report issued by a study committee nominated by the Italian Treasury Ministry said . The report , looking at the country 's financial development prospects , said Italy 's large public sector deficit and growing public debt were among the considerations that made a gradual liberalization preferable . The report also favoured retention of the lira 's six pct oscillation band with the European Monetary System ( EMS ) during the liberalization process in order to lessen short-term domestic interest rate fluctuations which could result from portfolio adjustments . The lira 's fluctuation margin is currently significantly higher than that allowed for other EMS currencies .

It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year . This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels , with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States , the report said . Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year , while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves . Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains , the report said . All of the gas reserve purchases , as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986 , were in the United States , Amoco said , noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years . Commenting on 1987 , Amoco said acquisitions " will be an integral part of our strategy , should reserves become available at attractive prices .

decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department , a State Department official said . " Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer , and he 's not going to the mat again . It 's now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do , " the official said . If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union , he said , " Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it . He might not come out in favor of it , but he wo n't go to the President and voice his objections . " In an official statement clarifying Shultz 's remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers , the State Department said , " Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible , U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets , including the Soviet Union . The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program . " Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets , there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow , the State Department official said . " Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered , we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy . " USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat , the official , who asked not to be identified , said . The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels . The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time , the State Department source said . " What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world , " he said . The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price , he said . Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA , most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz , who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets .

Delegation in Washington , said pending U.S. trade legislation is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation 's trade deficit and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form . " To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by legislation is a mistak e , " he told the Foreign Trade Association here . Denman told reporters that possible retaliation , which he warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski , would not necessarily be on a product-for-product basis . " Retaliation does not have to be matched product to product , " Denman said . He said in the case of textiles import restrictions , however , retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports . " Certainly , if restrictions were imposed on European exports of textiles to the U.S. , the Community would be likely to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to Europe , " Denman said . He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to cut those surpluses or face special tariffs . " This would conflict with international obligations , throw a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and could easily boomerang , " he warned of the tariff proposals . Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek reciprocity in specific trade sectors . " Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers would simply lead to retaliation from the other party , " he said , adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in another .

that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold , economists said . " There is ample liquidity The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month , " said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. " Technical and seasonal considerations aside , there is nothing for the ( credit ) market to get excited about , " added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed 's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday , compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods . Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks ' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln . Finally , a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed 's discount window for the third week running , with the latest week 's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks . While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period , economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks . The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements . " Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressur e , " said Salomon 's di Clemente , noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April . " The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement , " said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc , who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April . Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth , not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates . M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine , compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise . Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth . " The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March , " said Salomon 's di Clemente . Merrill 's McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges . In February , M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath . Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson 's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas , some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here . "Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else , " said Salomon 's di Clemente , adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy . Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy 's health would remain the main influence on policy but , contrary to di Clemente , he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first . Drexel 's Ramirez did not commit herself either way , adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February 's U.S. trade data are due for release . Reuter

buoyed recently by seasonal factors , are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins , money traders said . The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23 , they said . The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three , and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions . Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases , the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure , money traders said . Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates , they said . Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September . This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17,830 billion yen by the end-December , a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels , bankers said .

Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces , it added . Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February , the lowest figure for over 20 years , the paper said . The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers , it added . This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power , causing shortages to industry and households . The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground , Wen Wei Po said . Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China , media reports said . The People 's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February . The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984 . Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country 's tea crop , Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia , concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia 's wheat belt , local Meteorological Bureau officials said . For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat , the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does , they added . Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino , they said . Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region 's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause , El Nino 's role is being closely studied , they said . Accu-Weather Inc , which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests , said each El Nino 'event ' was unique . The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83 , it said . El Nino , Spanish for " Christ Child " because it appears around Christmas , is formed by the action of warm air , bearing clouds and rain , shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru , where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds , meteorologists said . The winds , strengthened by El Nino 's " pump " effect , raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia , they said . When the winds drop , the ocean , seeking equilibrium , sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru , they said . One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific , where they further disrupt other weather patterns . The prospects for an end to the droughts vary , Accu-Weather said . China , where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall , will have to wait for the May-September rains , it said . The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall . In Australia , areas of Queensland 's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season , but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end . In Sri Lanka , the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year . The year 's secondary rains usually occur between April and June , although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual . REUTER

States must do more to lessen its reliance on imported oil . President Reagan said during a nationally televised news conference that the rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil is a problem that the administration is studying . " We have to study this more , " Reagan said . " This is why we increased the Strategic ( Petroleum ) Reserve , but we have to do more , " he said . Reagan said his administration has already proposed deregulating natural gas and eliminating the windfall profits tax on crude oil production . However , he complained that Congress had not yet approved those measures . The Department of Energy earlier this week released a report that warned of rising U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports at a time when domestic production is declining . It suggested options for the administration to consider , but made no specific recommendations . Reuter

international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus , international monetary sources said . At a meeting this week in Paris , senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus , they said . Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen 's sharp rise against the dollar , they still tend to surge when growth picks up , according to the OECD. As a solution , the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy , boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy , they said . That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund 's executive board . The monetary sources said Japan 's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country 's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members . The United States , which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan 's fiscal stance , joined in the attack , he said . The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government 's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1 . Most independent forecasters , including the IMF , believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct , monetary sources said . The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen 's rise . The yen 's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market . Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus , which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs . Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen , Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently . The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar . Most Japanese politicians , including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa , are clearly hoping the yen will weaken , government officials said . At a meeting in Paris last month , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the United States and West Germany , agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels . Officials said that wording represented a compromise . Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months , before it weakens later in the year . Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar , perhaps by substituting the word " recent " for " current , " while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar 's weaker levels now , perhaps by use of the word " present , " they said . In the months leading up the February 22 agreement , the dollar dropped some 10 yen . The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency . Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts , which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen . Officials said there are already signs of that . More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad , they said . REUTER

said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , is still under way and will be completed sometime next month . The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far , and they said Japan would comment on the final results . A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies . The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries . Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study , the agriculture ministry officials said . OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May . One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81 . Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then , partly because of tight budgetary policy , and foreign currency factors have also changed , he said . " The study is Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country , such as geography , " the source said . He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world . " This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan 's farm market further , but this would have little impact on Japan 's agriculture policy , " he said , without giving further details . A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community , but Japan is a major importer , he said . Reuter

" The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s , when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement , " he said in an address to Florida educators .

Soviet-led Comecon ended talks here , having made progress on setting up formal trade relations , but no breakthrough because of Comecon 's refusal to recognise West Berlin as part of the EC , delegates said . Negotiators were trying to reach agreement on the draft of a joint declaration setting up official relations after 30 years of mutual non-recognition . John Mas len , head of the EC delegation , told Reuters as he emerged from the final session " We made some progress , but we have called for another meeting . " O fficials , who asked not to be named , said the Comecon team had refused to accept a clause in the draft declaration which would recognise West Berlin as part of the 12-nation EC . Under the 1957 Treaty of Rome all contracts and agreements signed by the Community must contain this territorial clause stipulating West Berlin is an integral part of the EC . An EC negotiator taking part in the three-day talks said " We wanted the territorial clause in , but Comecon said no . " A joint statement issued after the talks said progress was made towards clarifying positions , but another meeting would be necessary to complete the work . Any decision in principle to set up relations would require approval by the Community 's Council of Ministers and by the executive committee of Comecon . Zdzislaw Kuroski , deputy director of Comecon , who heads the East bloc delegation , told Reuters ahead of today 's session " We have narrowed our differences on a range of questions , but not on all questions . " Asked whether Comecon would accept EC insistence that any joint declaration stipulate West Berlin as part of the Community , he replied " This question is not contained in the draft which our side presented . " West German diplomats said they would insist on including the clause on West Berlin in any EC-Comecon agreement . The talks followed an earlier round between the two trading blocs here last September and the first-ever direct talks between the EC and the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic relations in January . The EC trades with individual Comecon member states despite non-recognition of Comecon . Last year , the EC had a five billion dlr trade deficit with East European states , about half the deficit of the previous year , due to a drop in the price of Soviet oil imported by the EC .

mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly reduce its energy problems , but the bank 's losses are still virtually guaranteed to continue , analysts said . The package of energy loans was sold at book value , so First City did not to show a gain or loss , said bank spokesman James Day . He added it was possible First City would sell more of the bank 's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans to raise cash . The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and to oilfield service and supply companies . Day said some had already been classified as nonperforming , or charged off as a loss , but he could not identify how many were included in those categories . The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache 's Energy Growth Fund , a limited partnership created last month with 90 mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties . First City , the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn in oil prices , lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986 and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other capital assistance . The Houston-based bank 's nonperforming assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yea rend , up from 563.1 mln dlrs at the end of 1985 Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in the troubled bank unless government assistance is available . " Their problems are not just limited to energy . They have a substantial portfolio in real estate . This sale in and of itself wo n't make the company look better to a potential buyer , " said Ray Archibold , a banking analyst with McCarthy , Crisanti and Maffei Inc. " It does reduce the bank 's exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount , " Archibold said , " but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans . " Of First City 's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs , about 14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers , analysts said . Its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation 's top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s . First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential came from its Energy Finance Co. , an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to " more venturesome " oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return . The other half of the loans were from First City 's lead bank in Houston . Chris Kotowski , an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co. , said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from First City in months . " It 's not going to solve all of First City 's problems but it 's a good transaction for them . It may be possible for them to sell additional loans , " Kotowski said . " Prudential can fund these things more cheaply than First City and there 's an incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as values are depressed " In a statement , First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the bank 's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to total loans .

charged the United States with breaking international trade rules by excluding Dutch-made fibres from the U.S. Market and said it would take the issue to the world trade body GATT . In the latest of a series of trade disputes with Washington , the executive authority alleged that a section of the U.S. Tariff Act was incompatible with the GATT ( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) because it discriminated against imported products in favour of domestically-produced goods . The Commission said it would ask Geneva-based GATT to rule on whether the section in question , which officials said had proved a barrier to many EC exporters , conformed to its rules . Commission officials did not rule out retaliatory measures if , after a GATT decision against it , Washington failed to bring the disputed section into line with international rules . The executive 's decision to go to GATT follows a complaint to it by the Dutch company Akzo <AKZO.AS> , whose " aramid " synthetic fibres have been banned from the U.S. Market because of charges by the U.S. Firm <Dupont > that the fibres violate the American company 's patents . Akzo alleged that the ban , imposed by the U.S. International Trade Commission ( IT C ) , was discriminatory and incompatible with GATT provisions . The dispute centres on the fact that section 337 of the U.S. Tariff Act gives the ITC jurisdiction over imported products . The EC Commission charged that EC producers did not have the same possibilities for defending themselves before the ITC as they would have in a normal U.S. Court . " Consequently the procedure followed ...Is less favourable than that which takes places in normal courts of law for goods produced in the United States , " it said in a statement . Reuter

considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices , an Agriculture Department offical said . " We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing , " said Bob Sindt , USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations . U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement . But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes . " If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing , we are not considering this ," he said . Sindt , however , did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system . " We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy , " he said . " If we become convinced that we need to make a change , then appropriate adjustments will be made . " Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA 's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates . He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week . Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting , including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums . He defended the USDA differentials , saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease . The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices . When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates , Sindt discounted the idea . He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that , under provisions of the program , these all have to be emptied by the end of March . Reuter

European governments unfairly subsidise the Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium in proceedings at the GATT civil aircraft committee , a GATT spokesman said today . The U.S. Presented its case for the first time to the aircraft committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) during a special two-day session ending today . GATT rules cover some 80 pct of world commerce . The 20-member committee agreed to open debate on the U.S. Complaint , starting with informal consultations and then holding a special session in July , trade officials said . " The tension has eased , " the permanent trade ambassador of the 12-member European Community Tran Van Thinh told reporters . " The U.S. Has decided to go through proper channels . " U.S. Trade officials again made clear their anger over what they call unfair government support for Airbus , voiced during a visit to European capitals in February . In a letter calling for the special committee meeting , Washington charged France , West Germany , the U.K. , Spain and the EC Commission with unfair practices on behalf of Airbus . The U.S. Charges that the Europeans are violating rules laid down in the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft . Washington presented its reading of rules on inducement to purchase aircraft and support for development of airlines during the special session and asked the committee to confirm its view . Official sources in the delegations said the U.S. Views would be considered during the informal consultations but the Europeans would also be free to bring up any complaints against American civil aircraft practices . Some delegates said the U.S. Position appeared to give such broad interpretation to the rules as to suggest that the civil aircraft accord needed re-negotiating . All these matters would be considered during the informal meetings . Reuter

told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines . C. Fred Bergsten , a former senior Treasury Department official , and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall . " They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls , " or unemployment will keep growing , Bergsten said . Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit , which hit 169 billion dlrs last year , will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar 's 35-40 pct decline since September 1985 . The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture , if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur , he added . Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt . The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline , he said . Rimmer de Vries , senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. , said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies , prolonged currency misalignment , debt problems of the developing countries , and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries . John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute , suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall . Reuter

American-caught herring and pollock , opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually , U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced . Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo . He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years . There was no immediate assessment of the value of current U.S. shipments , but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms . At the same time , Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish . He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement . Reuter

Nino " may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster , which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought , the U.S. Agriculture Department 's officer in Lima said in a field report . Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area , flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern , the report , dated March 17 , said . However , it said official sources still believe that this year 's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity . EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific . The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production . Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle . Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists , it said . However , the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn , and slow the decline in sugar production , it said . If El Nino picks up momentum , Peru 's fishing industry could receive a setback . But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in 1987 , almost 20 pct above last year , the report said . Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters , it said . It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March , April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest . " There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino only time will tell , " the report said . Reuter

public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit , analysts said . " In the longer-term horizon , Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesse s , " said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. Last week , Bally said it was considering the sale of another non-casino unit , its Six Flags amusement park unit , which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs . Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said " the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company , but in the long term we 'll wait and see how the offering goes . " Once Bally 's biggest revenue producer , the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2 mln dlrs , 28 pct of Bally 's revenues . Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300- 500 mln dlrs . Analysts said Bally 's decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it . " It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit 's debt , increase its cash flow and operating income , making it an attractive buy to a third party , " Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said . On Monday , Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct , or 5.8 mln shares , of the unit 's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share . About half the proceeds , 40 mln dlrs , will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing 's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover , according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson . Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit , a Bally spokesperson said . Analysts said Bally 's health club unit 's profits have remained strong , but are skeptical about the industry 's long range prospects . " The fitness club industry , over the last 10 years , has grown tremendously , but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle , " said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns . Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness , but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes . In addition , " the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry , " said one analyst . There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S. , excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations , according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry . Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit , which is the nation 's largest health club chain , Peltier said , " no one has the money to offer to buy it . " " The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization , " said Wayne LaChapelle , chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL> , the nation 's second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but " could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time .

crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter , an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said . Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell , author of the EF Hutton publication " Global Crop News , " said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain , possibly wheat , from the U.S. due to potential crop damage . " Compared with last year , the outlook ( for the Soviet winter grain crop ) is far more pessimistic ," she said . " But it 's still too early to talk about disastrous losses . A lot will depend on spring weather , not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop , but also for spring planting . " Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains . Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation , she said . The bitter winter cold temperatures which broke record lows that had stood for four decades also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops , she said . However , she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover , which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage . The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year , primarily from Canada , the European Community , Argentina and Australia , Martell said . She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand . Last fall 's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures , while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy . Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes , and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports . However , she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union , noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn . Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand . In 1984/85 , the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes . But in 1985/86 , the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total . While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes , many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes , she said . Reuter

In a summary of its World Agriculture Report , the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986 , with gains in almost every country . However , food needs in Central America rose , worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife . Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high , and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop , it said . However , may developing countries in tropical climates , such as Sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , and Central America , are not well adapted for wheat production , and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs , the department said .

formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments . In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the " Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 " , Peter Myers , Deputy Agriculture Secretary , said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop , down from 18 cts now . Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 . The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs , Myers said . The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter , R-Ill . Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist . The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years . It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower . For example , on the first 350 tons of production , a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 , 4.5 cts in 1989 , 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991 . The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years , whichever is less , USDA said . Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry . He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads . U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a " progressive contraction " of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year , he said . This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing . Furthermore , USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage . The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar . USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users . In fiscal 1987 , USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar . " Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing , " Myers said . The following table lists the rate of payments , in cts per lb , to growers and the quantity covered , in short tons recoverable raw sugar , under the administration 's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments .

to reopen March 31 after the winter , faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes , seaway officials said . Depressed grain exports , rising costs , and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year 's traffic levels and revenues on the 2,300 mile waterway , officials said . In 1986 , a season that ran from April 3 to December 27 , the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal , linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario . By comparison , in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal . The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year , about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31 , said William Blair , an executive member of Canada 's St Lawrence Seaway Authority. The seaway moves about one-half of Canada 's exported grain . Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses . The Seafarers ' International Union , which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts , has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers ' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions . " It 's 99.9 pct ( certain ) --I guarantee you a strike , " Roman Gralewicz , head of the Seafarers ' Canadian branch , has said . The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides . The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic . " We have n't had a strike on the seaway for years ...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect , " Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said . " These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway , " George Miller , vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association , an association of major Canadian shipping companies , said recently . The workers ' current contract expires May 31 . The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years , reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching . The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs ( U.S. ) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition . The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades . Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year , compared to last year 's 15 pct rise , while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway . Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway 's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs . " We may see and hope for a steady upward climb ...but we wo n't see a major increase for a number of years ," Hemsley said . A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits wo n't be felt for several years , Blair said .

facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months , Joe Clark , Canadian secretary of state for external affairs , said . Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement . " The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months , " Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California . " We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve . " Clark said that , as a practical matter , an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October . He listed environmental questions , particularly acid rain , and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington . On Wednesday , President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem . Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting , on April 5-6 in Ottawa , with Prime Minister Brian Mulr oney . In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group , Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes . " This rash of countervailing actions , where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests , " he said . Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington 's rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses , he said . " There are a number of Canadian companies that , in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States , have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements , " he said . In turn , he added , the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada . Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions . " What will come out of it remains for the negotiators , in the first instance , to propose , and then governments and congresses will have judge , " he said . In his prepared remarks , Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted , although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan . " Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada , " he said . REUTER Reuter

demand for natural gas , helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986 , analysts said . The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements . " Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year , " Michael Smolinski , an energy economist with Data Resources Inc , told Reuters . An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged , Smolinski said . Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel , national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive , Michael German , vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said . The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu , compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago . " We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet ( of demand ) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter ( 1987 ) ," he said . In addition to price competitiveness , availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas , Frank Spadine , senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted . Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales . These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year . AG A 's German contended that despite the drilling decline , much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins . Citing recent EIA statistics , German said , the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987 , but the surplus would not go away until 1990 . Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990 . While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas , notably in California and in the Northeast U.S. , an overall shortfall appeared remote . Reuter

sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips , senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige . Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States , they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties . President Reagan 's trade policy advisory group , of which Baldrige is a member , will meet on the issue Wednesday . " I am confident we will see action taken , " Sen. John McCain , an Arizona Republican , told reporters . " I am expecting sanctions at least , and even more than sanction s , " Sen. Pete Domenici , a New Mexico Republican , said . The senators , several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan 's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries . They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips . The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry , they said . Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions , Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters , " The clear import of what he said is that there will be . " " Japan ca n't just say they will comply . We think sanctions must be applied , " for past violations of the agreement , the California Republican said . The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems . Sen. James McClure , an Idaho Republican , said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries . But McClure said senators told him , " There is no doubt dumping is going on , " based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products . The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market . In return , the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips . Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact . Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year 's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit . Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries . The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September . The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui , a California Democrat . Reuter

expected to press Indonesia , the Third World 's sixth largest debtor , to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues , western diplomats said . Conable , who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo , will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers . He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia 's largest nation was being managed well , but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments . Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java , Indonesia 's most populous island . He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow . Indonesia , the only Asian member of OPEC , has been severely hit by last year 's crash in oil prices , which cut its oil and gas revenues in half . Japan 's state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects . Indonesia , a country of 168 mln people , has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending , devaluing its currency by 31 pct , and trying to boost exports , while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit . Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change , particularly in dismantling Indonesia 's high-cost protected economy . " O il prices , the debt crisis , the world recession , all call for major policy adjustments and external support , " Conable said in his arrival statement . But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month , he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes . " We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed , " Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport . Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs , according to the Bank , which makes it the Third World 's sixth biggest debtor . It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968 . Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see . Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia , but implied it wanted more . Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support , the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government 's trade reform measures , and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth . Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports , liberalise trade and encourage outside investment . Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia 's 215 state-run companies could be sold . But in a report last month , the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms . Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia 's high-cost monopolies , which control core areas of the economy . Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices . It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation . He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector . Indonesia 's current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1 , from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87 .

rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency , which has depreciated steadily . The bank said in a statement that from April 2 , banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not , as presently , at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction . This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower " marginal " rate , analysts said . " It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered , " a Western diplomat commented . The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions , known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market ( SFEM ) , began last September 26 . At last week 's session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar , the third fall in a row . " They were clearly worrie d And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend , " the diplomat said . The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly , not weekly , beginning on April 2 . It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday 's scheduled session would still take place , nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction . Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply , encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira . If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session , high demand could undermine the objective of the new system , analysts said . Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered , the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate the lowest successful bid . SFEM is a central part of Nigeria 's structural adjustment program , which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa . The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira , which was over-valued for many years , liberalising imports , boosting agriculture , removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy . The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards . Ishrat Husain , the World Bank 's representative in Nigeria , said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions . " So far so good " he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos , adding that only members of Nigeria 's import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit . Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect , he said . Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira 's black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September . REUTER

nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured . Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked . " We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system , " he said . " We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past . Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all ," Moore said . He added " The cost of failure is beyond calculation . It is our last hope and best opportunity this century . We will not get another chance before the year 2000 . " The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the " Uruguay roun d " talks last Sepember . The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Venice in June . The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful , with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round . The southerners ' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met . The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected . Moore said one aim was to " instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy . " Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits , as well as preventing " bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations . " The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community . The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter . American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals an end to agricultural subsidie s inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks , patents and copyrights new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT 's 92 member states .

again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar . Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday " We do n't have a target for the dollar . " He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar , saying " We really do n't talk about the dollar .

" The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing . It 's extremely strong , " he said . "As I 've said before , we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world 's free trading system , because if the largest market in the world ( the U.S. ) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930 s , " he said . While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism , it alone did not offer any solution , he said . " You must address this problem on the exchange rate side , but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone .

supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market , but at least this week 's offerings should provide it with some focus , economists said . " Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work , so the auctions should breathe some life into the market ," said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year , four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week . The " mini-refunding , " which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash , comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday , 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday . The market also faces the regular weekly three and six-month bill auction today , amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs . The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market . Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook , diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar . Moreover , the bond market 's inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas , like the U.K. , As well as in U.S. Equities . But according to the Merrill Lynch economists , there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit . " Customer activity has been light , but all on the buy-side , and there is a marked absence of selling , " they said in a weekly report . Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week 's sales . " The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings . Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider , it is still positiv e , " he said in a weekly market review . But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move . This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run . " Based on last week 's events , there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane , " said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc. Indeed , talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan 's new fiscal year on April 1 . And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week 's U.S. Auctions , such reports undermine market confidence . Even actions by the British , Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets , the Salomon Brothers ' economists said . Meanwhile , ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations , economists said . This week 's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders . Economists expect a rebound from January 's depressed levels . Peter Greenbaum of Smith , Barney , Harris Upham and Co said several areas , including transport equipment , should have bounced back . But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders . He forecasts a rise of two pct after January 's 6.7 pct slump . Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct . Friday 's consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain . Economists said energy prices the driving force behind the January rise rose more moderately last month , while food prices declined . Meanwhile , economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date . Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday . Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level . REUTER

Tehran radio , monitored by the BBC , quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by " a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world . " U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger , in remarks apparently unrelated to the broad cast , said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf . The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf . U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship " Silkworm " missiles , which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before . The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were " misleading propaganda .

over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia 's economic performance , Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) chairman Dennis Benbow said . Over one-third of Australia 's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices , he told the APEA annual conference here . This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country 's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs , he said . Australia 's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat , yet the government 's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry , Benbow said . Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86 , reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields , he said . Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted , with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted , he said . By 1992/93 , Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level , assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead , Benbow said . Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd , he said . Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86 , implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time , he said . At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar , annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs , Benbow said . Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's , the addition to reserves has been inadequate , he said . For example , the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years ' consumption , he said . He called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration . REUTER

It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact , he said . McIvor said 37 of the world 's 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered . Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years , three of them in the Middle East , he said . He also said that since 1970 , the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year . More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East , he said . McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability . " It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation , and minimum regulation , together with opening up of acreage for exploration , " he said . Increasing reliance on the Middle East will also boost the incentive to use natural gas and synthetic sources of petroleum , he added . REUTER

point reduction in the Australian government 's maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output , resources analyst Ian Story said here . A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day ( BPD ) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88 , he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference . Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd. Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate , Story said . The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil that discovered before September 1975 is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production , accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue , he said . He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct . " The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs , " Story said . Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency , increase government revenue , boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development , he said . The government is currently reviewing the oil tax structure . REUTER

will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates , Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said . He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries . Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo . " I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countrie s , " Mamman said . " The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries . " Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth ( GDP ) rate of three to four pct by 1990 . Yet at the same time Africa 's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990 . " With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists , " Mamman said . Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness , he said . " The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports , " he added .

over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates , as seen in last month 's Paris pact , extend to keeping down European interest rates , banking economists said . But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany 's economy , they said . The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention , economists said . Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April . " The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant . They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates , " Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study . It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar 's fall . These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabil ized . West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point , to avoid weakening the dollar . West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline . " It 's not a taboo , " Peter Pietsch , spokesman for Commerzbank AG said . But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year , as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year . The Bundesbank 's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year 's low . Last week , yields fell to around 5.50 pct , not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April . Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper . Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates , which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate . It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates , as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank 's central bank money stock aggregate . But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts , part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth . This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing . This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak , but demand could emerge if rates begin rising . Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources , including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth , and higher than expected spending . Josef Koerner , chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut , said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November . Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up . But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar 's decline , long term yields may to have to rise , economists said . Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn 's tax reform package . The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion . West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable . Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform , such as raising indirect taxes . But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing . The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits . The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985 . The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures , and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year , when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter .

Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting that , in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September , a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved . Hata , speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting , said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy , but did not elaborate . Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever , reflecting financial deficits , payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries . Despite great potential , developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties , particularly debt , he added . The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este , Uruguay , and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva . " It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled , " Hata said . Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others . In order to rebuild the free trade system , it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end . As part of its contribution , Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan 's domestic market more open to developing countries , he said .

John Dawkins said if the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) does not give high priority to agricultural trade reform it will be neglecting the area of greatest crisis . In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries . He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem . " We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD ( Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development ) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform , " Dawkins said . The Venice summit is scheduled for June . He said Australia 's interests in the Uruguay Round , the eighth under the GATT , are wide ranging . Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system . Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este , Uruguay , have made a reasonable start , but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes . " We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice .

Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community ( EC ) imposed a levy on vegetable oils . Concepcion , speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) here , said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted . He said the EC not only ignored Manila 's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries . Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers , he noted that " I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value . " He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices , but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services .

forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87 , Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd ( AWF ) said in its first preliminary crop forecast . But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year , the private forecaster said , as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season . Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks , it said . The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost , credit and yield pressures . But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average , AWF said . Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct , AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops .

European Community ( EC ) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world 's three major trading and economic powers the EC , the U.S. And Japan set a poor example for other members of GATT . Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes . New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked . The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts . Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years . " Countries do n't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is , maybe , five or six years in the future . " He also said he did not consider the new U.S. Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago . "That 's a very healthy development , " he added . "If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist . " " Members of Congress , that is the contemplative members of Congress , have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit , " Yeutter said . " They 've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and , in my judgement , more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago . " He added , " Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matt e r . " REUTER

threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless , and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region . Tehran radio , monitored by the BBC , quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by " a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world . " U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger , in remarks apparently unrelated to the broad cast , said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf . The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf . U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship " Silkworm " missiles , which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before . The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were " misleading propaganda . " He said Iraq 's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use " all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension . " Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. " We are fully prepared to do what 's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway . " " We are n't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen , but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area , " he said . Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual . A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea . The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region . REUTER

again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar . Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday " We do n't have a target for the dollar . " He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar , saying " We really do n't talk about the dollar . " He said protectionism was becoming "extremely strong " in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries . " The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing . It 's extremely strong , " he said . "As I 've said before , we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world 's free trading system , because if the largest market in the world ( the U.S. ) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930 s , " he said . While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism , it alone did not offer any solution , he said . " You must address this problem on the exchange rate side , but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone . It 's far more comprehensive and broad than that , and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach , " Baker said in the interview .

nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured . Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked . " We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system , " he said . " We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past . Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all ," Moore said . " The cost of failure is beyond calculation . It is our last hope and best opportunity this century . We will not get another chance before the year 2000 , " he added . The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the " Uruguay roun d " talks last September . The talks are also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Venice . The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful , with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round . The southerners ' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met . The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected . Moore said one aim was to " instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy . " Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits , as well as preventing " bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations . " The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community . The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter . American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals an end to agricultural subsidie s inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks , patents and copyrights new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT 's 92 member states .

Board ( CMB ) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments , trade sources said . The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings ( the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs ) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered , but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure , they said . The board 's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole , since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda 's total exports . The CMB 's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa , Dar es Salaam and Tanga . These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems , the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports . Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks . However , an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15 , causing fresh delays in cargo movements . Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs . Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags . These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda 's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 ( October-September ) crop , the sources said . According to the sources , the board 's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts . The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers , whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process , they said . The sources said the CMB 's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda 's high inflation rate , unofficially estimated at about 200 pct , and that this was a further disincentive to producers , already owed large arrears . " The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind , the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic , and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear , the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whol e , " one of the sources said . The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda 's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife .

as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it , Donald K. McI vor , an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview . " Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable , " McIvor said . Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence , McIvor said . McI vor , Exxon 's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast 's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding . " Since 1970 we 've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year , " McIvor said . " The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity , " he added . McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 " one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered . " McIvor said , in response to a question , that he did not believe there were any more " super giants " , or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels , to be found which would change the conclusion of the world 's growing dependency . " Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East . Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east ( Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska 's North Slope ) . " McIvor said . McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska 's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline . But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east , particulartly in Canada , the North Sea , and Australia and Africa . McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies . " The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policie s , " McIvor said . McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy . Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but " the thrust of his ( Herrington ) report is valid . It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production . " McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs . " Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worl kd 's energy supply , " McIvor said . " Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat , as an industrial fue l , " he added . Reuter

salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further . " We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastroph e , " Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters . " If hasty action is taken in the United States , it will create very serious problems . " The Reagan Administration 's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year . Under the pact , Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors . Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports , and has threatened to take retaliatory action . In an effort to save the agreement , MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export . Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter . This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year . He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market . " We have almost no grey market ," he said . " Supply is diminishing . " To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented , MITI called in the president of Japan 's largest semiconductor maker , NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week , he said . It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc> . Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers . The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz , Treasury Secretary James Baker , Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter . The four , who make up the Economic Policy Council , are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong . Yamamoto admitted that <O ki Electric Industry Co> 's Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices . " If the United States uses this as proof of dumping ...We will present our rebuttal , " he said . The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI 's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping , he said . He also called the case " strange , " but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales . He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week .

prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia , which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago . Aweke Aynalem , head of the government 's Agriculture Development Department , told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season , one of two each year in Ethiopia. Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year , of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the " belg " ( small ) rains which fall at this time of year . The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley . Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season , because farmers eat their stocks of seed . Aweke said peasants in Wello , Tigre and Hararghe regions which suffered severely from drought were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains .

Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders . Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders . Under the terms of Portugal 's January 1986 accession to the European Community ( EC ) , a grain import monopoly held by EPAC ( Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais ) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990 . Following legal proceedings by private importers , Lisbon 's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part , as it had done , in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports . As a result of this ruling , EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize . Barreto said , " My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part . " He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders . Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator , whether public or private , from the tenders . Private traders had argued that EPAC , given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market , had an unfair advantage over them . " There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system , " Barreto said . He said the EC 's executive commission had accepted the government 's view that EPAC should be eligible . The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC 's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal 's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency 's import monopoly .

warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles , U.S. defense officials said today . " We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers " to ship their oil , one of the officials told Reuters . " But if there is superpower protection , we would rather it come from us ," the official said . The officials , who asked not to be identified , said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels , most of them oil tankers , which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf . " We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer , " one official said . In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy 's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz , the Pentagon has moved 18 warships including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month . White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran 's recent stationing of Chinese-made anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf . The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected . Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 . White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz . But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics , but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region . " We are fully prepared to do what 's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world , " he said on NBC television 's " Meet the Press . " The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf . The communciation was sent through Switzerland , which represents American interests in Iran . Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran , Tehran Radio said . An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman , quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London , said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless . " In conjunction with this misleading propaganda , America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions , aiming to build up its military presence in the region , " he was quoted as saying .

The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action . It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran 's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday . A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran 's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time . The Kharg terminal , attacked about 135 times since August 1985 , was last raided in January . The communique did not identify the supertanker , but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it . In London , Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday , when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack . But there has been no independent confirmation of today 's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours . The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight , when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg . Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran 's offshore oilfields at Nowruz , Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf , some 80 km ( 50 miles ) west of Kharg island , today 's communique said . The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years . Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran 's oil export trade . A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front . It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf . Two Iranian boats wer destroyed and sunk with their occupants and the others fled , it said . Reuter

precisely how to arrange the import of third country maize and sorghum into the EC in fulfilment of its agreement with the United States , Commission sources said . Under the accord , reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership , the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990 . All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries . The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year , as it was rather late to make other arrangements . They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports . There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries , although such a tax could be imposed later , the sources added . Reuter

the United States should consider an oil tariff to keep U.S. dependence on imports below 50 pct . "On the supply side , the argument in favor of a contingent , variable import tariff is most persuasive , " Krapels , president of Energy Security Analysis , Inc said in a statement at a House Energy and Power subcommittee hearing . " An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the international price of crude oil falls below , say , 15 dlrs a barrel . On the demand side , the obvious policy is an excise tax on transportation fuels , " Krapels said . But William Johnson of the Jofree Corp disagreed with the oil tariff proposal , saying Congress should remove price controls on natural gas , repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies , allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax incentives for U.S. oil production , or , at the least , preserve exisiting tax incentives for drilling . He also urging filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate . Richard Adkerson of Arthur Andersen and Co told the subcommittee oil imports were expected to increase because funds for exploration and development of domestic oil sources cannot now be economically justified due to low oil prices .

The preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals . American Express said it will maintain 60 pct , or 60 mln of the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding . American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January , 1999 . American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed . American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly . American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre-split basis . Both dividends are payable May 8 , to shareholders of record April 3 . There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding . The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance , which is expected in April . American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London . The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management , market research and consulting on financing .

markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band , said Leo Melamed , chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's , CM E , executive committee . " The target zone would not affect our market I think at all A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market ," Melamed told Reuters in an interview . " We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift , " he said , referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s . "One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value . " As chairman of the CME in 1969-71 , Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures , which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange . Melamed said capital flows which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations . " They can do it for a day , in terms of intervention , an hour , a week maybe , but not over a period of time . So it 's unrealistic and it does n't work and it 's unnecessary . " The CM E 's top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called " triple-witching " day . " We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue ( triple witching ) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June , " when the move is scheduled to go into effect , he said . Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor 's 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading . Two weeks ago , the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account . The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups . The changes " will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace . That 's going to prove very , very instrumental in increasing volume over time ," he said , predicting the increase would come within a year . Melamed , also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc , said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index 's daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program . The CME also received " many negative comments , many more than we anticipated , " Melamed conceded .

stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis , Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said . He said in a parliamentary debate , " I can now tell the House ( of Commons ) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October ( 1986 ) have subsequently all been repurchased at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds . " Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise , he said . The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point . During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week , he said that " during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September , I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for . " He said that that one percentage point increase , effected in October 1986 , had been reversed by this month 's two half point cuts in banks ' base lending rates . They are now at 10 pct . Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986 , government sources said .

Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture . Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last September . Yeutter said " at least people seem to be going down the same road ...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirel y . " There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and " a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there , " Yeutter said . However , the hard work is still to come , with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead , he said . " It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy , " he said . He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas . This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating , he said . Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process , but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years , he said . It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that , which is an ineffective use of financial resources , he said . Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations , he said " one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it ( agricultural trade reform ) done in two to three years it 's going to have to be as part of a larger package . " REUTER

Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community ( EC ) proposed a levy on vegetable oils . Concepcion , speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) here , said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted . He said the EC not only ignored Manila 's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries . Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers , he noted that " I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value . " He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices , but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services . " The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed , " he said . REUTER

Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986 . Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market . It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23 , he said . Wang Chao-ming , vice chairman of the government 's Council for Economic Planning and Development , told Reuters the rising reserves were " a big headache for Taiwan . " He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S. , Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S. Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products , especially those from the U.S. Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan 's trade surplus , which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier . Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S. Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang 's remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time . " We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington , " he said . He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies . Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses . He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls , but declined to give details . The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985 . It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year , some foreign bankers said . REUTER

oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach , Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here . He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government 's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry 's concerns . Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation . Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years . These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old ' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct , and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September , he said . The industry , through the APEA , has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia 's relatively low exploration levels . " While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime , I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes , which leave ( government ) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas , " Evans said . He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation ( R RT ) legislation , now before parliament , in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible . As previously reported , RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas , based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects . APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects . Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government 's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime , adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules .

( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners , U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said . Yeutter , in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks , told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient . " That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round , " he said . " The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems . " The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 . Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time . The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed , he said . " Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that 's the basic objective of the new GATT round , " he said . But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour . It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries , but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years . " It 's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two , " he said . " They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future , " he said . REUTER

" A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct , " he said .

Duties , royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation . " It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy , technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production , " he said . " The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way , " he said .

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration 's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact , agreed last year after months of negotiations , calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors . Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action . Yesterday , Tamura 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan 's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output .

In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. O fficials , MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets .

Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto , he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy . Indonesia , hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half , is the Third World 's sixth largest debtor . It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years . Conable said the World Bank , which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments , was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices . " We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy ," he said . He said Jakarta 's willingness to move quickly after last year 's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries . Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis , and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports , encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy . However , key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place .

despite a serious drought because the State Council ( cabinet ) has spent one billion yuan on irrigation and other anti-drought work , a Hong Kong newspaper said . Wen Hui Bao said the drought , which has affected Shanxi , Hebei , Henan and Shandong the most , has eased with March rains in south China and March snowfall in the north and as some new irrigation projects have come into use . " If the drought does not worsen , there is hope for a bumper harvest , " it quoted experts of the Ministry of Electric Power as saying . They gave no figures . The 1986 summer grain harvest was a record 93 mln tonnes , up from 92 mln in 1985 , out of a total 1986 grain harvest of 391 mln . The 1987 target is 405 mln . REUTER

in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month 's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates , senior foreign exchange dealers said . Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen , dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down . Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month 's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down , the dealers said . " The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement , " said Koji Kidokoro , general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd 's treasury division . He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency . " This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention , " Kidokoro said . Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency . They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today , including direct purchases through brokers , and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York . Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar , but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen . " If the dollar drops to that low level , it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities , which the Americans do n't want , " said Haruya Uehara , chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31 . But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish . This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. E c on omy , the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package . " The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan 's inertia in stimulating its economy ," said Hirozumi Tanaka , assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd 's international treasury division . In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures , after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed , to boost domestic demand , increase imports , and thus reduce its trade surplus . The package was expected in April , but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax . In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future , Dai-Ichi Kangyo 's Tanaka said . Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar . REUTER

Australian Petroleum Exploration Association ( APEA ) said it will press on with its campaign for major improvements to Australia 's petroleum taxation structure . The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government 's position on taxation , as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference . As earlier reported , Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum . APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development , the council said . It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans , but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax ( R RT ) legislation . Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure . " The government 's unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based , " the APEA council said . The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry 's concerns , despite its recognition of the industry 's problems , the council said . The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum , citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices . REUTER

producer , Santos Ltd <STOS.S> , said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil , condensate and liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) . The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985 . Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production , particularly of oil and LPG , along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays , were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate . Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue , and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier . It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders ' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54 . Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMO C Resources Ltd> valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs . Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge . At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs , enough to meet all 1987 repa yments . Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program , finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia , but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves less than depletion during the year . Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct . Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism . But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme . " It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia 's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly , " Massy-Green said .

Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time . She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . Secondly , support for agriculture should avoid production incentives , and thirdly , countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices , Carney said . Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collecti vely . Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos , Switzerland , in January . European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates , and not only the European Community , voiced reservations about some of the principles . Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way . " The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion , " she said .

Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion , who two days ago expressed doubts about agreements produced at international conferences , said he was pleased with the latest gathering here . Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal . " Also , the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting . Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countrie s , " he added in an interview with Reuters . " In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion ( in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations ) will be of more benefit to the developed countrie s , " he said . Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a " shining act of faith " in the world trade system . Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive . He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers , quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations . Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples . He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New Zealand , which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines , to encourage it to switch imports from other countries .

Sumita 's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40 . " It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates , " Sumita said . The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system , he said .

Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture . Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last September . Yeutter said " at least people seem to be going down the same road ...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirel y . " There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and " a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there , " Yeutter said . However , the hard work is still to come , with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead , he said . " It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy , " he said . He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas . This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating , he said . Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process , but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years , he said . It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that , which is an ineffective use of financial resources , he said . Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations , he said " one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it ( agricultural trade reform ) done in two to three years it 's going to have to be as part of a larger package . " REUTER

At today 's Cabinet meeting , Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan 's unfair trade practices in semiconductors . Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration 's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S. That pact , agreed last year after months of negotiations , calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors . Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action . Yesterday , Tamura 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan 's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output . In his letter , the contents of which were released today , Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets . In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. O fficials , MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets .

A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct , the officials said . They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction . Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels , the officials said .

The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe , chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff , during a Middle East visit . Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran , but would not let Iran use Chinese-made " Silkworm " anti-ship missiles , capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf , to choke oil shipments to the West . Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels , most of them tankers , could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman . In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy 's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz , the Pentagon has moved 18 warships , including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk , into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month . White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran 's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf . The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf .

Banks , which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity , will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22 . The allocation was in line with market expectations the Bundesbank would provide more than the 3.4 billion marks draining from this week as an earlier facility expires . Call money fell to 3.60/70 pct ahead of the allocation from 3.75/85 pct yesterday , dealers said . The excess allocation compensates for public funds leaving the system which the Bundesbank added last week via government-owned banks . However major tax payments by banks on behalf of customers drew to a close this week , lessening the need for liquidity . The call money declines surprised some dealers , who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today . However , most said this had not occurred .

said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations . Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention , if necessary , in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations . Canada , Britain , France , Japan , the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels . Sumita 's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40 . " It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates , " Sumita said . The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system , he said . The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries , the Paris statement said .

dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month 's Group of Five ( G-5 ) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies , dealers and bank economists said . " The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention , " one dealer for a German bank said , echoing widepread sentiment in the market . But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists . Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further . Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention , the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today . It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further . " The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen rang e , " Chase Bank AG 's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said . Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop . " Window-dressing " operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency . Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical . U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down . " Suddenly , support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared , " one dealer said . The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs , and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge , dealers said . Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary . Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies Japan , Britain , Canada , France , the U.S. And West Germany to take action in line with the pact . But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning . Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act . While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks , others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated . The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 , when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks . " The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment , " one dealer said . Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done . Some said Baker 's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter 's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift . " It 's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands , " a dealer said . Another added , " If the Americans do not get what they want , they will push the dollar down , regardless of G-6 . " Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter . " It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction , " Citibank said . It added , " Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year . " And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report , " We are looking for a further , more gradual , fall , possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year . " But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal . Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker 's and Yeutter 's comments . " There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down , " a senior dealer said . REUTER

money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today 's auction , which a bank spokesman termed " heavy . " Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds , the spokesman said . He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year 's eight pct target for M-4 , defined as liquid assets in public hands . Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January . Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986 . A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation . The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year . " Money supply control is the government 's chief weapon against inflation , " he said . " The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad . " He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital . The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad . REUTER

( General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ) round is needed to halt growing bilateral trade problems between major trading partners , U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said . Yeutter , in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks , told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient . " That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round , " he said . " The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems . " The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986 . Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time . The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed , he said . " Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that 's the basic objective of the new GATT round . " But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour . It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries , but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years . " It 's a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two , " he said . " They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future , " he said . Reuter

promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year , private economists say . Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year , as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending . But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy , although some economists remain cautious about the outlook . The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs , a six pct rise , to 101.2 billion dlrs . Even excluding volatile defense goods , durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct , the agency said . The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts , whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct . The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year , said Lyle Gram ley , an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association . The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct , the lowest rate since March 1980 . The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase , the government said . The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter , said Gram ley . Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter , Gramley said . He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending . He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units . Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue . Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 , accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter . The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar 's value over the last year and half . " The improvement will be gradual and long lasting , " Levy predicted . Most of it will be through import reduction , but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas . The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit , which soared to record levels last year , will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year . As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit , the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others . U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries . The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt . The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter . There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad . The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms , the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 . While fourth quarter economic growth was weak , corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period , the government said . It also reported that inflation , as measured by the GNP price deflator , remained in check , growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period , the lowest rise in 19 years . The government also reported that consumer spending , a key element of the five year economic recovery , jumped 1.7 pct in February , after falling two pct in January . The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector , which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy , was showing signs of recovery . In its latest report on current economic conditions , the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving . Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish . Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar 's value . He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity , but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either . He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power . " That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years ," Chimerine said . He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years . Reuter

linked increased borrowing by Indonesia , the Third World 's sixth largest debtor , to fresh measures to deregulate trade and dismantle protectionist barriers . " We would like to see the Indonesian government continue the adjustment process To move towards increased deregulation of the economy ," Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta . Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia 's hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency . The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan . He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted . But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes . " The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government . We are not here to dictate to them ," he stated . Indonesia , the only Asian member of Opec , has been badly hit by last year 's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half . Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto . He voiced support for measures already taken , including September 's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah , and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports . " The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today 's world , " he said . The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years . Lending is now about one billion a year . The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia 's protected monopolies in areas like steel , plastics and cement , western bankers and diplomats said . The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures , but has given no timetable . It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies . Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects , which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed . Japan 's Ex-Im bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month . REUTER

John Herrington said he was " optimistic " about the chances of providing a more generous depletion allowance for oil and gas producers , but added that the plan faces strong opposition from some members of the Reagan administration . Herrington , speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting , said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was " heavy and strong " largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry . Herrington 's proposed tax incentives for the oil industry were issued last week after the Department of Energy released a comprehensive report finding U.S. national security could be jeopardized by rising oil imports . In response to a question from Mitchell Energy and Development Corp <MND> chairman , George Mitchell , Herrington said the report did not definitively rule out an oil import tarrif . " We intend to keep that debate open , " Herrington said . However , following his speech , Herrington told Reuters that the new report shows an oil import fee " is not economical . " Herrington said , for example , a 10 dlr per barrel tariff on oil imports would cause the nation 's gross national product to drop by as much as 32 billion dlrs . Herrington also said he believed President Reagan , who requested the comprehensive national security study , was committed to some action to help the ailing U.S. oil industry .

International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy , the official Sudan News Agency ( SUNA ) reported . Finance Minister Beshir Omer , quoted by SUNA , said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods . SUNA , monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation , said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Ab del-Shakour Shaalan . Sudan , burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs , is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF , which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year . In February 1985 , Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar , adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency . Since then , it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments , arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices . Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers . Dealers in Khartoum 's thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today . With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency , black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries , mainly Egypt , Kenya , Ethiopia and Zaire . Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks , but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan 's economic performance . The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country 's economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears . This , they said , could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors , grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club , to reschedule debt payments . Twenty-three pct of Sudan 's total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club , the diplomats said . Sudan 's Finance Minister said last month the country 's IMF representative had told him the fund 's executive board was " very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months . " The representative , Omer Said , said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia , to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs , to help Khartoum to pay more . Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30 . REUTER

European Community ( EC ) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme , a Commission spokesman said . Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20 , when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme , and March 13 , according to latest commission figures . The food , including 30,000 tonnes of cereals , 6,000 tonnes of sugar , 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter , has been distributed to the needy through charities . The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year 's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31 . But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system . The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units ( 72/78 mln dlrs ) . This is above the 50 mln Ecu ( 57 mln dlr ) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers . However , commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates . On the other hand , the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight . EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter , 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals . Reuter

oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies . The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration 's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment . The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980 . A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos . But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration . " Here , injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable , " Justice Byron White wrote for the court . " And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined , " he said . The oil companies , Amoco Corp <AN> , ARCO , Exxon Corp <XON> , Mobil Corp <MOB> , Sohio , Shell , Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil , had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses . The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs . Administration officials , saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study , denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources . The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins , along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta , argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing . Reuter

exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year , Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said . But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations , the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985 . The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax , with Petroleum Revenue Tax ( PRT ) representing only 16 mln stg , he said . As a result , post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln . Earlier , Shell U.K. , a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> , reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg , up from 667 mln in 1985 , on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln . Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company 's crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986 , which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company . Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd , due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field , he said . Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987 , he said . A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months , Reid said . The Kittiwake field , originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell , is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg . Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields , which were approved last year , have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget . Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year , and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant . The company drilled 17 wells offshore , with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons , although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries , Reid said . Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985 . Jaap Klootwijk , managing director of downstream unit <Shell U.K. Oil> , said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a " bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986 . " In November and December in particular , refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices , he said . He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer , although they could dip to become negative from time to time , depending on price movements . A new catalytic cracker at Shell 's Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988 , about five months behind schedule , following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year , he said . Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site . Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief , by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT , was " helpful , " but rather less than had been hoped for . Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs . If prices went much above that , he would expect some over-production above OPEC "s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down . He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding , bringing supply and demand into balance , but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall .

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , said commodity prices could form a useful guide for setting domestic and international monetary policy . Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation , Heller said , " A broadly based commodity price index may be worth exploring " as a guide to monetary policy . " In times of rising commodity prices , monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices , monetary policy might be eased , " he said . Commodities are also standardized to avoid measurement problems and occur at the beginning of production so as to give " early warning " signs of wholesale and retail changes . " There is no need to react to every small fluctuation in commodity prices or to do so on a daily basis , " Heller said in a prepared text . " But if commodity prices exhibit a broad trend , a policy action might be considered , " he said . Heller said using a broad-based commodity price index as an indicator for monetary policy would also contribute to stabilized currency exchange rates . Commodity prices are generally uniform worldwide and prices for them are more consistent than for other types of goods , he said . He said other beneficial effects would be to stabilize export commodity prices for developing countries by using a commodity basket as a guidepost for monetary policy . Reuter

KUNA also said the envoy had discussed the deployment of Iranian missiles near the Strait of Hormuz with Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary Suliman Majed al-Shaheen . A British naval source in the Gulf said today Iran had test-fired its new Silkworm missiles and set up launching sites in the area . The tests had been successful and the missiles could be used against shipping in the strait , the source added . But Iranian Parliamentary Speaker Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said Iran did not need missiles to close the strait because " we can close it with artillery onl y .

oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20 , oil analysts and traders said . They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels . Analysts were divided on the crude stocks . Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher . Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels . Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13 , traders said . The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13 . Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends . For the week ended March 13 , API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels . Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year , because retail prices are still low compared to recent years . U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13 . Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week . Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher , while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week . The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell . The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13 . Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20 . Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices , traders said . But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range , they added , the effect will be bullish . Any stockbuild would be a negative factor , they said . Crude runs normally increase in March , and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market , said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc. Reuter

test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling , until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement , analysts said . Since the six-nation accord last month , sterling has risen sharply , adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index . While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements , the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates . But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday . The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene . Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively , the Paris accord could collapse . "On balance , sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses , " Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said . He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies . However , although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling , none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency . Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook , firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates , they said . Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week 's budget , seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters . Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies , where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain 's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound . In addition , sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks . A further half-point cut , widely expected in the next week or so , has already been largely discounted . U.K. Base rates , now running at 10 pct , are still relatively high compared to other western countries , and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling . Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar 's decline , dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis . Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets , however , were reflected in the U.K. Government bond ( gilt ) market , where prices dropped by up to 5/1 6 point . Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling . Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday 's U.K. Current account figures for February . Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January 's small surplus . REUTER

with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry , boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986 , chairman Lord Barber said . Barber said in a statement on the bank 's 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions , both general and specific , stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985 . Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision , which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks . New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision . In all , a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986 , compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985 . Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985 . " The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region , on top of the normal level of provisio ning , " Barber said . He said , " the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks . " Barber said due to bad-debt provisio ning , the Asia Pacific region made " a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits . " He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was " well maintained , although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisio ning , " while Californian subsidiary Union Bank " showed continued growth . " " Tropical Africa , Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued , " he said . Barber said the group , which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LL OY.L> last year , strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg , while total assets increased to 32.2 billion .

Cooperative Futures Co. , the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years , will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution . The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month , citing falling volume and increasing costs . Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark , Inc. , which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock , led to the call for dissolution . The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership . Ironically , it was Growmark , at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators , that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1 , 1960 . But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur , Ill. , and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies , ADM/Grow mark . With that relationship , Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative , said Tom Mulligan , president of the co-op . Membership in the company , which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives , has declined from 99 in 1982 . A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa , which became affiliated with Cargill , Inc. Illinois Co-op 's other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain , based in Indianapolis , Goldkist , of Atlanta , Ga. , Midstates in Toledo , Ohio , Farmland Industries in Kansas City , Mo. , Farmers Commodities , Des Moines , and Harvest States in Minneapolis . Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system . Instead of banding together , the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways , said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade . Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant , he said . Don Hanes , vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives , said 5,600 cooperatives exist today , down from 6,700 five years ago . " The period we 've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch , " he said . " There 's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops . " One problem , he said , is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export , rather than exporting it themselves , losing potential profits . But exporting grain requires heavy investments , and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co. , a co-op set up to export grains , served " to make folks gun-shy , " Hanes said . Mulligan said he believes the dissolution , if it is approved , is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics . A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm " was a convenience , something that saved us a little bit of money . ( Its dissolution ) will force us to change our way of doing business . " " We 're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside , " he said . " But there are lot of people out there to do business with . There are plenty of capable firms . " Steven W. Cavanaugh , vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain , said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative . " In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals , there would be economic savings , " he said but added , " The times change and with changing times , come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around . " Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability . " I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble . It is a sound , healthy organization . " In the year ended February 28 , 1986 , the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members ' equity , or net worth , of 8.3 mln dlrs . The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed . Under the cooperative system , income from operations is returned as " patronage refunds " to the members . Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining . In the year ended February 28 , 1982 , the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs . Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28 , 1986 , totalled 9.5 mln dlrs . "You 're dealing with substantially lower volume , " Mulligan said . " Lower volume translates into higher costs . " According to the company 's 1986 annual report , Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to . He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution . Equity is distributed according to each member 's trading volume and , as a result , changes from year to year . However , Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out . Reuter

Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day , Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said . Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly , Hernandez said PDVSA 's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986 , down 45 pct from last year 's 13.3 billion . Fiscal revenue from oil sales , which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986 , totalled 43.5 billion , a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said " had a very serious impact on Venezuela . " PDVSA 's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day , of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products . The figure surpassed PDVSA 's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd . But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year . The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank . Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA 's overseas refining and marketing operations . Consumption in Venezuela 's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year . However , Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd . Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes , shifting the balance of Venezuela 's reserves away from heavy crude oil . The country 's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd , of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes , Hernandez said . Venezuela 's total proven reserves as of December 31 , 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels , the fourth largest amount in the world , Hernandez said . Reuter

Corp <XON> , will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending , the company said in the annual report . Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987 , compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985 . Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year . Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years . The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987 . During 1986 , the company cut operating , administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500 . Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained . " It is still a time for prudence and caution , and the company 's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand , " he said . Haynes said prospects for the company 's petroleum products division are more promising than before , but are still uncertain . Imperial 's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985 . Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States . The company 's chemicals business outlook is mixed , Haynes said . Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues , but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices . Imperial 's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986 , compared to three mln dlrs in 1985 . Reuter

But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed , it said . The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC 's earnings should be positive , it added , as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business . The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November , CPC said . Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring . As of December 31 , CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares , adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January , for a total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs , according to its 1986 annual report . In December , CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs . CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt , including that incurred under the share buyback . In total , CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock , adjusted for the split , it said today . In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares , adjusted for the split .

Committee voted to ease restrictions on exports that are now kept from shipment to Soviet-bloc countries but are no longer a threat to U.S. national security . The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration 's export control policies , which restrict shipment of thousands of products , contributed to last year 's record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit . The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries . Rep. Don Bonker , chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee , said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year .

The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls . Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments .

" Bywater 's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a U.S.-Japanese semiconductors agreement . The pact , agreed to last July , called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. goods . In return , Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors . But U.S. officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the U.S. market , it has not ended third country dumping nor has it opened its market to U.S. semiconductors .

foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar 's losses today , but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat . Although the intervention was widespread , dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies . Moreover , hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline , dealers said . " The market can be bigger than the central banks . And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore , " said a dealer at one major U.S. bank . As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan , Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency . Reports of the authorities ' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East . But it still failed to regain Monday 's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen . Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve . Meanwhile , there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today . Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen . The Fed 's last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan . But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks . The authorities ' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , Britain , France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels . But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities ' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market . For one thing , some dealers believed that the Fed 's purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U.S. central bank 's own account , suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord . The Bank of England 's action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank , reinforcing the market 's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact . " No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious . But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else , " said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. " I 'm not convinced the intervention was concerted , " said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago . " It 's a yen problem more than anything else . " Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen . " The dollar 's break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury 's hands behind its back . The U.S. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here , " said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized . Despite official denials , some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation 's trade deficit . The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan . Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker 's comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat . " The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services . The currency market is becoming very political , " said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May . Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies , it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future , dealers said . " Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year , it wo n't be enough to help the trade situation much ," said Bourdain of BankAmerica , who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days .

In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its outstanding common shares , GenCorp had suggested the adoption of a classified or " staggered " board and the elimination of cumulative voting . GenCorp said these proposals could " distract energy and attention from the real task at hand to respond to the tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the company , its shareholders and its other constituencies .

Board , Paul Volcker , has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday . Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad . He added , " even Japan , against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed , " has started opening its markets . In his letter , made available at the Treasury , Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks , was a problem . " I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt , " Volcker said . It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries , he said . Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker "about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt , which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facilit y . " He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates " is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects . " " For example , the bill 's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations , " Volcker said . He recommended " we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations " on exchange rates but instead use other , more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies .

likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years , Agriculture Department officials said . USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31 . Agriculture Department analysts said next week 's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres , down 22 pct from last year 's plantings of 83.3 mln acres . Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings , U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly . Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels . Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program , along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program , will cause acreage to plummet , Department feedgrain analysts said . " There 's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage , " one said . " It 's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year . " Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct , USDA analysts said . Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below , they said , compared to last year 's level of 61.5 mln acres . If analysts ' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u .s . corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program . Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983 . A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels . Given normal weather conditions this year , USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels , down from last year 's crop of 8.3 billion bushels . " This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production , " an analyst said . A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage , so surplus stocks , while not decreasing , would not increase significantly , a specialist said . High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions , based upon historical participation in government programs , analysts said . In contrast , soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt , a USDA soybean analyst said . " Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge , " he said . Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas . Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year 's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion , he said . U.S. soybean acreage , after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that , has steadily declined in the 1980's . U.S. corn acreage , with the exception of 1983 , has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years . The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre . Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre . " We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so , " an analyst said . Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same , analysts said . Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage . " To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres , we would have to provide more incentives , " an analyst said . Reuter

Under existing criteria , USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations ' unfair trading practices . Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D- V t . ) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies , sources said .

The measure , sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , would clarify the definition of " industry " in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers . Grassley 's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine but not fresh , chilled and frozen pork were harming U.S. producers . The bill 's proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork . Reuter

today vowed to do everything possible to fight the U.S. action against Canadian potash exports , but also warned against raising the alarm too early in the dispute . In the latest flashpoint in Canadian-U.S. trade relations , the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled unanimously Monday that Canadian potash shipments valued at 270 million U.S. dlrs last year were injuring the U.S. industry . " We certainly intend to do everything we can to insure that Canadian interests are well protected , " Clark told the House of Commons in the daily question period . But he said the opposition parties should be careful " not to raise false alarms too early . " The case now goes before the U.S. Commerce Department 's trade division to determine if a duty should be imposed . Potash producers from New Mexico , claiming unfair government subsidies , are seeking a 43 pct tariff on Canada 's shipments . Canada , the world 's largest potash producer , exported 9.8 mln metric tonnes of potash last year , with nearly a third going to the U.S. Most of the potash , used in the production of fertilizer , comes from provincially owned mines in Saskatchewan . In the Commons , Liberal member Lloyd Axworthy branded the ruling as just another " trade harrassment " from the U.S. and criticized Clark 's assurances the country 's interests would be protected . " We received exactly the same kind of assurances in the softwood lumber case that was totally fumbled and bumbled , " Axworthy said . Canada 's Progressive Conservative government agreed to impose a 15 pct duty on its softwood lumber exports earlier this year to end a long and bitter bilateral trade dispute with the U.S. Axworthy urged the government to present Canada 's case to world trade authorities under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . But Clark maintained the potash dispute was another example of why Canada needs to find a new way to settle bilateral irritants in the free trade negotiations under way with the U.S. " What we are seeking to do is put in place a better system , " Clark said . Meanwhile , Saskatchewan Trade Minister Bob Andrew expressed confidence Canada would win its case , claiming the problem stems from low international commodity prices and not government subsidies . " The reality of the problem and the injury is caused worldwide , " he said . " It 's caused by a downturn in the commodity price for fertilizer , whether it 's potash fertilizer , nitrogen fertilizer or whatever . " Reuter

The U.S. Economy is not good , and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good , the U.S. Will put various pressures ( on Japan ) . " " The yen 's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan 's economy , and as long as the American situation is bad , the yen will continue to rise , " he said . To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen , Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means , including holding down wages as much as possible , Otsuki said . He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand . " We have to keep wages as low as possibl e , " he said . He also said the yen 's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy , noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports . Parts of the service sector are also threatened , Otsuki said . Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries , he said . It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector , he said . Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988 , leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy , he said . Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986 . The government 's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986 , the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis . In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy , tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation 's housing stock are needed , along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities , he said .

Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business , which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London . The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade . Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues , and the slide of the Lebanese pound , can be expected to be major talking points . About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday . Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market , by far the largest in the region , is being carried out in London . The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia 's 11 banks , foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain . But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London . As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined , many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations . None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island . The two major Bahrain-based international banks , <Arab Banking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing . One economist said " It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London . " Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank > set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984 , while its main rival in Saudi Arabia , <National Commercial Bank > ( NCB ) won a licence in November 1986 . The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank <Saudi International Bank > but the kingdom joint-venture <Saudi American Bank > ( SAMBA ) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February . One senior currency trader in Riyadh said " Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA , but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia . " Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify . Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks , most in Saudi riyals , dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion . The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits . Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday , the Gulf weekend . Traders also expect <Arab National Bank > to step up London operations . Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region , partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary A gency 's ( SAMA ) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation . There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited . But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon . Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates . But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC 's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year . One dealer said " A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced . But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead . " One open question is that of a common peg for currencies . The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC . The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar . Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies , but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct , large enough to avoid sudden strains . Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks . REUTER

expected to nearly double to 80 mln U.S. Dlrs in calendar 1987 and rise to 400 mln dlrs a year by 1991 , a five-year forecast by the Economic Ministry showed . Taiwanese investment in the U.S. Last year totalled 46 mln dlrs , the ministry document said . The investment was mainly in electronics , trading , food and service industries . Lee Ming-Yi , deputy director of the ministry 's Industrial Development and Investment Centre , said the forecast rise is due to planned government incentives and growing willingness among Taiwanese to invest abroad . Lee told Reuters the incentives , to be introduced in May or June , include bank loans and a reduction in capitalisation requirements for businesses seeking to invest in the U.S. To 10 mln Taiwan dlrs from 20 mln . He said the moves to encourage investment in the U.S. Are part of Taiwan 's efforts to cut its trade surplus with Washington , which rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 1985 's 10.2 billion . Taiwanese manufacturers can create jobs for Americans and avoid import quotas if they set up plants in the U.S. , He added . REUTER

oilfield in the Gulf , shut since an aerial attack last November , will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are ready , and this could be in the next two months , oil industry sources said . They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise des Petroles ( Total ) <TPN.PA> , whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field , have agreed on the reopening , but that a date has not been definitely fixed . Unidentified planes hit the field , 100 miles off Abu Dhabi , last November 25 . The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production platform . Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq. Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) at the time of the attack , but the sources said it would resume at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable . The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in remaining accomodations , the sources said . Facilities being installed to protect the field include aircraft detection equipment , anti-aircraft missiles , housing for military personnel and helicopter landing pads , the sources said . Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab Emirates , accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15 mln bpd production , the sources said . They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field , part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only a few miles away . Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked . REUTER

Bumpei Otsuki , president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers ' Associations , ( Nikkeiren ) , told reporters " The yen might rise as far as 140 ( to the dollar ) . The U.S. Economy is not good , and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good , the U.S. Will put various pressures ( on Japan ) . " " The yen 's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan 's economy , and as long as the American situation is bad , the yen will continue to rise , " he said . To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen , Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means , including holding down wages as much as possible , Otsuki said . He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand . " We have to keep wages as low as possibl e , " he said . He also said the yen 's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy , noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports . Parts of the service sector are also threatened , Otsuki said . Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries , he said . It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector , he said . Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988 , leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy , he said . Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986 . The government 's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986 , the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis . In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy , tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation 's housing stock are needed , along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities , he said .

Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals , he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals . Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement , which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end . He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary , adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely . But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals . In Paris on February 22 , Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels . Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday .

U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar . U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained . The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-J anuary , Sumita said .

( PNG ) provides the most exciting new prospect in the Asia-Pacific region for oil production , energy analyst Fereidun Fesharaki said here . The recent successful find at Iagifu is likely to put PNG on the list of major oil exporters by the early 1990s , he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference . Fesharaki , leader of the Energy Program at the East-West Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , was speaking on the Asia-Pacific petroleum outlook . With domestic demand of around 12,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) and prospects of production of over 100,000 bpd by late 1991 , PNG would become an Ecuador-level crude exporter , Fesharaki said . The Iagifu wells in the Papuan Basin have recorded the best oil flows in more than 60 years of exploration in PNG . The PNG government 's Geological Survey in a paper distributed at the conference estimates Iagifu reserves at about 500 mln barrels . PNG enjoys the most liberal tax regime in the region with no secondary taxes , Fesharaki said . " We expect a much larger oil search in Papua New Guinea , and discovery of much larger volumes of oil , similar in quality to ( light ) Bass Strait crud e , " Fesharaki said . There are also large pockets of high quality condensates to be produced , notably in the Juha field near Iagifu which is capable of producing 30,000 to 40,000 bpd , he said . But prices should be somewhat higher than the present levels to justify development of the Juha field , he said . The PNG Geological Survey paper noted there are five large prospective but little-explored sedimentary basins in PNG . REUTER

of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen , dealers said . The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks , they said . Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday . The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers ' remarks . Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month 's agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability . One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves . He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks . Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range , and above 150 yen , with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks ' resolve to defend currency stability . But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen . Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness . This week 's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact , dealers said . Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen .

proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production , but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken . One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods . Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year . The White House , reacting , said it did not favor amending the tax code , but would look at the proposal . Herrington 's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department 's report on energy and the national security . The report said U.S. oil imports , rapidly rising , could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security . He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production , not cause economic dislocation , and be low cost to the taxp ayer . Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test , spurring production but fail the second and third . He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs , but at the same time it lifted oil prices , the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs . A tax on gasoline , he said , would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production . In any case , U.S. officials say , President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax . Options which meet Herrington 's criteria include Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices . It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs . A five pct tax credit for exploration and development . It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day , at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year . A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures . It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day , at a cost of 65 mln dlrs . Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration . A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs . Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas , which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily . He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf , which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil , and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , which may hold nine billion barrels . Herrington said he understood the Reagan 's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals , but added he hoped his department 's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry . Another move Herrington said he will press anew , even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House , is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000 . This , he said , would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption . Reuter

will provide a 350 mln dlr oil industry aid package that includes cash incentives designed to cover one-third of a company 's oil and gas exploration and development costs , Energy Minister Marcel Masse announced . The aid program will inject about 350 mln dlrs a year into the oil and gas industry and could lead to more than one billion dlrs in new investment , Masse told a news conference . The program will affect drilling done anywhere in Canada on or after April 1 , 1987 . Masse told reporters that the government 's oil industry aid package is aimed at small and medium sized companies . The aid package , called the Canadian Exploration and Development Incentive Program , will restrict the total payments that any individual company can claim to 10 mln dlrs a year . Masse said the program will probably generate new employment equivalent to 20,000 people working for a year . He said oil industry aid is needed because exploration and development spending dropped by at least 50 pct since world oil prices fell during the first half of 1986 . Energy Minister Masse said the federal government decided to provide cash incentives so a large number of non-tax paying companies , mainly small Canadian firms , will receive the full value of the incentive . Such companies would not immediately benefit from tax benefits , he said . The federal government also wanted to deliver an aid program outside the tax system . Finance Minister Michael Wilson is now reviewing Canada 's tax system and plans to announce tax reform proposals later this spring . An important feature of the aid program is a decision to let companies issue flow-through shares , allowing investors to benefit from the subsidy rather than restricting benefits to only participating companies , he said . Allowing flow-through shares under the program will make it easier for companies to attract investors in exploration and development , Masse said . He told reporters his department is still considering whether to allow partnerships and other entities to qualify for the subsidy . Reuter

Congres sman , Jerry Huckaby , D- La. , warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners , perhaps including corn sweeteners , if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year . " We 're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct ( the U.S. sugar program ) ," Rep. Huckaby , chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues , told Reuters in an interview . Huckaby , who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases , said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday . He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject . Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota , now at one mln short tons . " I think if we 're talking about dropping ( the quota ) another half mln tons , lets say , you 're getting to the point where the program might not work ," he said . " Ideally , I 'd like to freeze things right where we are , " said Huckaby , leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress . A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons , the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct , and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons , Huckaby said . A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year , he said . " I feel like if we did n't expand production , we could probably hold where we are indefinitely , or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes ( in the sugar program ) ," Huckaby said . However , much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct , Huckaby said . He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S. But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share , then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced . Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon . " This program is advantageous to the corn users . They have some natural , legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved , " Huckaby said . Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled , either through production allocations , acreage or marketing controls . Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production . " I do n't know if we will go this route , but if we do there 's a question in my mind at this point in time can you do that legally ? " he said . Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners , Huckaby said " You build a fragile house if you do it that way . " Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production , because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain . But he said for sugar growers as a whole , expansion would not be good policy . Huckaby said he has tried to stress , in his speeches to sugar industry groups , that if growers continue to expand , they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year . Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program . " The administration proposal is so drastic , that I do n't think it will get up a head of steam , " Huckaby said . He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved . Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program , Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community 's sugar policy . He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market . Reuter

with many banks , universities and government statistical offices on strike and more pay disputes looming . Bankw orkers ' leaders said that a national strike launched yesterday to press for a 100 pct immediate pay rise and monthly salary adjustments had the support of most of the 700,000 workforce . The strike today closed the stock exchanges of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro . For the government the one positive development on the labour front was the gradual return to work of the nation 's 40,000 seamen , who began a national strike on February 27 . A union spokesman in Rio de Janeiro told Reuters about half the seamen had returned to work after accords with 22 companies and that the strike looked close to an end . Otherwise the labour scene looked bleak , with the bank strike posing the most serious problems for Brazil 's crisis-laden economy . " If this goes on for more than a few days it will have a serious effect because normal financial operations will grind to a halt , " said a western diplomat in Sao Paulo . Today Brazil 's 50,000 university teachers in the 42 federal universities launched a national strike , with a broad political demand as well as a pay claim . David Fleischer , head of the political science department in Brasilia university , told Reuters the National Association of Higher Education Teachers wanted a full congressional inquiry into what had happened to government education funds . He said the universities were strapped for cash and that the association suspected the junior partner in the coalition government , the Liberal Front Party , PFL , of using education funds for projects which had helped their candidates in elections . The PFL holds the Education Ministry . Hardly any sectors of the economy are proving immune to the current labour un rest , caused by the return of high inflation , officially pegged at 33 pct for January-February . Other possible strikes looming include stoppages by oil industry workers and social security workers . Reuter

reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop , which will begin to be harvested in mid-April , trade sources said . They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes , down from last week 's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February . The new forecast is still higher than last season 's record total production . Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop . The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes , 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season 's new estimates . Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires . The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall . Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield . The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares , 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares . The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense , heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm . Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates . The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts . In other areas , especially western Buenos Aires , where rainfall was more than 200 mm , parts of the sunflower , maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged . The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba , La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios . The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares , two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86 . The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes . This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes . The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods . A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields . The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares , down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year 's record 3.14 mln hectares . Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes , 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes . The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains , advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown . The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares , 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season . Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes , 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes . Reuter

committee with jurisdiction over trade said he was concerned about a resolution on bilateral trade negotiations adopted by the Canadian House of Commons last week . The resolution supports negotiation of a bilateral trading agreement with the United States while protecting Canadian political sovereignty , social programs , agricultural marketing systems , the auto industry and Canada 's cultural identity . Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen said the resolution may jeopardize the viability of the proposed free trade agreement between the two countries , which are each other 's largest trading partners . " We need a truly free trade agreement , which means both countries have to work toward a deal that is mutually beneficial and comprehensive , a large agreement , " the Texas Democrat said in a statement . " I do not question Canada 's right to protect its political sovereignty or cultural identity . However , if these phrases mean the government of Canada means to take important economic issues off the table in these negotiations , I am deeply concerned , " he added . Bentsen said Canada restricts trade 15 different ways while the United States uses only six trade restriction methods . He said if Canada proposes an agreement where both countries get rid of six methods of trade restriction , it would not be fair and might not win Senate approval . " I am deeply concerned that when the President visits Prime Minister ( Brian ) Mulroney next month , he will be presented with this kind of argument , and I hope he makes it clear as I did when I was in Canada that only a mutually beneficial agreement will be successfu l , " Bentsen said . Reagan and Mulroney are scheduled to meet April 5-6 in Ottawa .

Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil 's judgement by two billion dlrs , to 9.1 billion dlrs , Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30 . Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986 , down from 2.69 billion a year earlier . However , inclusion of Texaco 's equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985 . Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln , respectively . Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion . The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year , down from 714,000 in 1985 , with about 44 pct of the decline some 24,000 barrels per day representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986 .

savings , launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department 's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow , amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office , GAO , are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers . The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind , or PIK , certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays , administration officials who asked not to be identified said . USDA officials , however , took issue with the report , saying it did not take into account storage , handling and transport savings that accrue to the government . The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs , sources said . The issue is an important one , because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending . Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow . Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays , and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp , CCC , almost equal costs , department sources said . USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store , handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage . It was unclear whether the GAO , Congress ' investigative arm , would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs , Reagan administration sources said . The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind , PIK , certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold . The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates . The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates , or certs , as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters . Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash . Between April and December 1986 , CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates , according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987 , according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate . Eliminating this practice , called " PIK and roll , " would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92 , according to the Congressional Budget Office , CBO . That estimate , according to a CBO official , was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments . The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives . The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs , or between five and 20 pct , more than cash outlays , one administration official said . However , the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism , department officials said . The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year . USDA 's Economic Research Service , for example , has found that between June and August last year , the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel . Between September and November , however , certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices , according to the ERS study , obtained by Reuters . Reuter

Two of the group 's members , Venezuela and Mexico , are second and third largest foreign suppliers of oil to the United States , respectively , following Canada . Venezuela , concerned about the effect such a tax would have on its exports , undertook a diplomatic push to coordinate strategy against such measures .

" We were quite satisfied with the agreement in Paris otherwise we would not have been a party too it , " he said . Baker also noted the nations agreed in the accord to " co-operate to foster greater exchange rate stability around those levels . " He refused to comment directly on the current yen/dollar rate but said flatly that foreign exchange markets recently tended " to draw unwarranted inferences from what I say . " Baker was quoted on British Television over the weekend as saying he has no target for the U.S. currency , a statement that triggered this week 's renewed decline of the dollar . " I think the Paris agreement represents evidence that international economic policy co-ordination is alive and well ," Baker said . The Treasury Secretary stressed however it was very important for the main surplus countries to grow as fast as they could consistent with low inflation to resolve trade imbalances . He added that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker has also " been very outspoken " in suggesting main trading partners grow as fast as they can . Baker noted that the J-curve , the delayed beneficial effect of a weakening of a currency on that country 's trade balance , takes 12 to 18 months to work its way through to the trade deficit and it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar 's value .

He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures , including market intervention , to stabilize exchange rates if necessary , in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations . He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last . Six major nations Britain , Canada , France , Japan , the U.S. And West Germany agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable . Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan . He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased . To prevent a resurgence of inflation , the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions , he said . He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand . Commenting on the dollar 's fall below 150 yen , Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency 's weakness . The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension , he said . Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1 , 1988 , provided exchange rates stabil ize . REUTER

talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks on other trade reform in the present GATT round , Willy de Clercq , external relations commissioner of the EC , said . He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to reach an early , seperate agreement on agricultural trade . He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) in Punta del Este , Uruguay , last year . That included agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT . Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT round include reform of trade in merchandise and services . De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand . Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for urgent reforms . U.S. Trade representative , Clayton Yeutter , also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade reform was reached as early as possible . But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after long and hard negotiations , and the EC did not want changes . " We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached , and that was very clear that the new round would be one undertaking . It is a global negotiation with no two tracks , no fast track , no slow track . It has just one track , the track and that 's all ," de Clercq said . " If you start selecting priorities , your priority is not my priority . We say that agriculture is urgent , but it 's not the only urgent thing , " he said .

surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January , a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said . The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January , she added . The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks . The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986 . But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986 . A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors . Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted . February imports , measured in terms of value , totalled 32.11 billion marks , a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January . Exports in February , also in value terms , totalled 42.56 billion marks , 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January . The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February . But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct . Within the current account , the services account had 300 mln marks deficit , supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit . Taking the first two months of 1987 together , imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier . The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks , a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986 . The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period . The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier , the Statistics Office said . Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors . The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged . " The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least , " said an economist . He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks . An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft ( BfG ) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany 's trade position . He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December . " The trend is clearly lower , " he said . This economist , who declined to be named , said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January , when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather , both of which hindered trade .

prospects even though foreign markets have become more difficult because of the mark 's strength the Economics Ministry said . The ministry 's parliamentary state secretary Ludolf Georg von Wartenberg , told a business conference German exports could start rising again in real terms during 1987 , reversing the lower export trend which emerged in mid-198 6 . But even if the turnaround did not occur , there would be no need to worry about the economy as long as the weakness of exports did not affect currently good domestic demand . Von Wartenberg said consumer demand remained quite good but noted there had been a cooling in the investment climate . " This is certainly a reason for heightened watchfulness but not for stimulative steps , " he said . The best way for Bonn to help its exporters is to work actively to promote free world trade , he added . Von Wartenberg said the economy still had good export opportunities . Price alone was not the only factor in international competitiveness , he said , adding German firms have a reputation for high quality standards , prompt delivery times and good service . Von Wartenberg said the government was in a difficult position on its trade figures . It faced international pressure to reduce its trade surplus , but West Germans were worried about the effect of the mark 's strength on the country 's exporters . Reports about the trade surplus , especially overseas , tended to concentrate on nominal trade figures , which rose to a record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 , he said . But this rise was due entirely to the lower value of imports caused by the decline of both the dollar and oil prices . German exports have in fact been falling in real terms for sometime , he said .

industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention , dealers said . The dollar 's fall below 150 yen , which follows last month 's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , Britain , France and Canada , is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five ( G-5 ) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar , they said . The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides , dealers said . Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States , Japan , Britain and West Germany , they said . Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar . The dollar was sold anyway . Yesterday 's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment , dealers said . The intervention , backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita , which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt , has done little but slow the rate of its decline , they noted . The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today 's huge currency markets . Dealers said the market 's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars . " This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand , " said Koichi Miyazaki , deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank . Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen . The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York 's 149.30/ 40 . Its record low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday . Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again . The market expects the seven nations ( the Paris six plus Italy ) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention , a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said . Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations , particulary the U.S. , Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S. Trade deficit , especially with Japan . Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington 's options , they said . The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall , not to push it back over 150 yen , said Tadahiko Nashimoto , manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan . Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September . The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation , dealers said . Yesterday 's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand , they said . The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1 , dealers said . " The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen , " one dealer said . The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen , he said . Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen , it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145 . REUTER

Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain 's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected .

lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln , compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season . In its monthly market report , the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87 . The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments . The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes . It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln . The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere . The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect . At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries . There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off . Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook , the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada . U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise . After damage to its maize crop last year , the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops . Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987 , the IWC said . Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87 , the IWC said . It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes , respectively , against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier . After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season , the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC , Canada , the U.S. And North Africa .

showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg , up from a 73 mln surplus in January , has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates , analysts said . Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome , with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg , against the official figure of 224 mln stg , sharply narrower than January 's 527 mln deficit . " The figures are unreservedly good , " Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said . Sterling rebounded on the trade figures , reversing a weaker morning trend , to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday , unchanged from yesterday 's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level . The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling , which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates . Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards . But sentiment now looks to have turned about again . There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded , Wroblewski said . Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January . Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion . However , Chris Tinker , U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months . He forecast the Chancellor 's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods . However , Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data , cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg . He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry . The growth in imports appears to be flattening , even if January 's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers , Harwood said . U.K. Government bonds , or gilts , surged by more than 1/2 point on the bett er-than-expected news , as earlier worries about the figures evaporated . Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs , before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT , nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960 . However , analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news . Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government 's support was slipping . LONDON , March 26 The Bank of England said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning , buying bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct .

surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success , the International Wheat Council ( IWC ) says in its latest monthly report . Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas , as employed in the United States , the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters Argentina , Australia , Canada , the EC and the U.S. In some countries , for example Australia and Argentina , which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income , there may be problems in reducing production . A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment , with job prospects outside agriculture limited . Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems . The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries . They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated . Alternatively , support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold , without needing to be stored for a long period . This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production , the report said . The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture , possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production . The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 . At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses . These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency . For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units ( Ecus ) . It dollar terms , the currency in which most export transactions are denominated , the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 . The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure , the report says . The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 . This was partly due to increased production in China and India . The period saw an upward trend in yields , although this was countered in the Argentina , the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages . In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises , particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives .

" I do n't think it 's ( a tax increase ) is a very good idea and I 'm quite confident that President Reagan does n't think it 's a very good idea , " Baker said in an interview on Cable News Network 's " Moneyline " television program . He said U.S. taxpayers are taxed at a rate of 19 pct of GNP which is traditionally where it has been , but the Federal Government is spending at a rate of 24 pct of GNP . Baker said spending cuts are clearly the best way to cut budget deficits . Baker said he opposed a stock transactions tax proposed by House Speaker Jim Wright , D-Tex , or other special taxes . " The stock transfer tax would be a particularly unfortunate approach to take , " the Treasury Secretary said . He said the United States has some of the most efficient capital markets in the world and new taxes would impair efficiency . On the international front , Baker said banks must do more lending to developing countries . He was questioned about this after the Standard and Poor 's Corp downgrading today of the debt of six major money center bank holding companies , largely because of their heavy developing nation loan exposure . Baker said that developing countries must adopt free market economic policies such as in the United States . He said capital flows will be required to support the needed reforms in the economic systems of those countries . The money must come either through equity or debt and Baker said that developing nations ' " investment regimes do not support enough equity investment , so you 've got to have some debt there .

to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January , The Trade and Industry Department said . The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January . Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus , the same as in January . Seasonally adjusted , imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January . Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January . Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain 's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected . The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures . The seasonally adjusted volume index , base 1980 , a guide to underlying non-oil trade , showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5 .

The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion pesetas . A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in view of disappointing money supply figures for February . The M-4 money supply , measured as liquid assets in public hands , rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and compared with this year 's eight pct target . Money supply growth was 11.4 pct last year . The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas . Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demand for funds . " The policy is proving counter-productive and rates will have to come down in the long-term , " the bank spokesman said in reply to Reuters e nquiries . He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term speculative capital from abroad .

showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg , up from a 73 mln surplus in January , has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates , analysts said . Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome , with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg , against the official figure of 224 mln stg , sharply narrower than January 's 527 mln deficit . " The figures are unreservedly good , " Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said . Sterling rebounded on the trade figures , reversing a weaker morning trend , to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday , unchanged from yesterday 's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level . The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling , which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates . Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards . But sentiment now looks to have turned about again . There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson 's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded , said Wroblewski . Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January . Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion . However , Chris Tinker , U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months . He forecast the Chancellor 's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods . However , Ian Harwood , economist at Warburg Securities , said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data , cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg . He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry . The growth in imports appears to be flattening , even if January 's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres , Harwood said . U.K. Government bonds , or gilts , surged by more than 1/2 point on the bett er-than-expected news , as earlier worries about the figures evaporated . Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs , before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT , nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960 . However , analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news . Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government 's support was slipping . The Marplan poll , published in " Today , " showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct , from 38 pct last month , while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct , from 21 pct , to run neck and neck with the Labour Party , whose own support fell from 38 pct . The poll was taken after the Budget , which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent , political observers said . Another regular poll is due tomorrow , and eonomists warn that today 's improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again . This upsetting of the markets ' political perceptions , which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election , made them more sensitive to the trade data , Harwood said . " The news did come as a very , very substantial relief , " he said . However , on the interest rate front , economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall . They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates , so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed . REUTER

In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee , Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that " further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects . " But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation , " We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges . " Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments . He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives " or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention " would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures , he said . Accordingly , Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive . Commenting on the trade deficit , Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year , due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months . But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U.S. competitiveness . He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate . Reuter

will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied , a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association , Het Comite , told Reuters . Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and , since December , has lodged more than 80 individual cases with the Business Appeal Court in The Hague . The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another country . Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain commodity board . The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration Court in the Hague . Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10 . The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company for the test case from among the 80 lodged " because the bill ( the firm ) received from the commodity board for payment of the levy contained significant currency distortions and involved grain from a wide variety of origins . " The name of the company is not being made public . The Administration Court is not expected to make a final ruling on the case in the near future . The Het Comite spokesman said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal Court in Luxembourg , and " as a result it could easily be another nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved . " Meanwhile , the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is collected , the spokesman said . Het Comite , as a member of FEF AC , the association of European animal feed manufacturers , is also a party to actions protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court . Reuter

Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce " reasonable stabilit y " in exchange markets over the next few months . He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to " see if there ca n't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility " to give time for the committments in Paris to take place . Asked by Sen Phil Gramm ( R-Tex ) whether U.S. intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar , Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments , current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals . In particular , the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the U.S. to cut its budget deficit , Mulford said in his testimony . He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth . Mulford noted that half of West Germany 's economy was affected by international developments . He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more U.S. exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the U.S. , as Gramm asserted , if Japan reformed its domestic capital market . Commenting on the Paris agreement , Mulford said , " I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so ( G ermany 's and Japan ' s ) efforts can be carried out . Mulford rejected Gramm 's argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar . Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the U.S. trade deficit . Otherwise , he said , the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a U.S. recession , both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable . Reuter

small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month 's meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada , foreign exchange dealers said . But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation . A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday . Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan . The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations , not necessarily on its own account , but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31 . One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar . Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market , a departure from the central bank 's usual insistence on confidentiality . But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention , which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale . " Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs , you would still be talking of a small overall amount , " said one dealer . Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen . " This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend , " the dealer said . Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar 's trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen . These ranges were set in February 's stabilisation agreement reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan , Germany , France , Britain and Canada . But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar .

Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and employers , economists and money market dealers said . Call money fell in quite active trading today , dropping to 3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday , and below the 3.50 pct treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached . But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for fear of upsetting the current wage round . One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said , " I do n't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever happens . But it also does not want them to fall . Above all it wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes . " In West Germany , unions and employers prepare the ground for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments of growth and inflation , economists said . Ute Geipel , economist with Citibank AG , said if the Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy , raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the medium term , unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands . As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move that would interfere in the negotiating process , Geipel said . In the current round , the country 's most powerful union , the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers , is demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages . The engineering employers ' association , Gesamtmetall , is offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1 , 1988 , and give a two stage wage increase a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this year and another 1.5 pct from July 1 , 1988 . The agreement forged by IG Metall Europe 's largest union , with 2.5 mln members and the employers would set the benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the public sector , banks and federal post office . Negotiations began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by early April , ahead of the traditional holiday period in June . Though many economists said the unions ' current warning strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and would not lead to a repeat of 1984 's damaging seven-week strikes , others said unions would not compromise greatly on their positions and there could still be conflict . This could extend the length of time in which the Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key , economists said . The money market head said the unions ' humiliation by the protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy . " The unions have n't forgotten that and they will put this squarely onto the account in the negotiations , " he said . In addition , the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall union , Franz Steinkuehler , was more radical and determined than his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership . More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms , mainly in south Germany , held warning strikes lasting up to two hours yesterday . Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH. Today , 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in warning strikes , a statement from IG Metall said . Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on a politically-inhibited Bundesbank . About eight billion marks were coming into the market tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government . As a result , some banks fell back on the Bundesbank 's offer to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills , anticipating still lower rates before the month-end . But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers was due on Monday , other dealers noted . If banks were short of liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday , rates could soar , perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling . Banks were well stocked up with funds , having an average 52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first 24 days of March , well above the 50.7 billion requirement . REUTER

the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets . She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K. 's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case . " I wrote to the prime minister of Japan , Mr Nakasone , on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid . I have not yet had a reply . We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is ," Thatcher said . Thatcher told Parliament that " shortly We shall have more powers than we have now , when , for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available , then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do . " Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa . But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company . REUTER

The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports of 267.7 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 312.4 mln tonnes in 1985 . It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct , or 200 billion tonne miles , with shipping demand associated with the coking trade down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles . The report sees EC imports falling to 91.7 mln tonnes in 2000 from 123.6 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89 mln from 124.6 mln tonnes .

intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co , BP Managing Director David Simon said . " We do n't seen this as any progressive bidding game , " he told reporters at a news conference . BP now owns 55 pct of Standard 's stock . Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst , whom he would not identify , as saying BP 's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer . " I think that ( an increase ) would be totally wrong . I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation , " he said . " Let 's wait and see how the offer runs . " Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid . The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard 's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company 's assets , including the value of its oil , natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves . He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow . The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard 's stock price over the past year . BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third 's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources . The rest will be financed by new debt . BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit , he explained . The company 's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed , Chase said . But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months , he added . Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil 's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions . Simon said Standard 's board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time . He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition . " We have informed Washington of our intentions and we 've already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves , " he pointed out . Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained , and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production . " We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime , " Simon said . " We have hopes for greater stability , but we do not see prices going much higher , " he added . Reuter

7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch , analysts said . " I think that BP 's bid is a very strong affirmation and clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S. , and they think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher , " said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70 dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own . " It 's a 7.4 billion dlr price that ( shows ) OPEC has won the war and oil prices are not going to crack , " said Prescott , Ball and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier . " Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the energy issues out there in the stock market , particularly those that are acquisition targets , " Lazier said . One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp , an energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a Court last year . Rumors continue to swirl around its stock . Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms falling into takeover situations for several years , with the exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp <AHC> . He said most of the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking which ended two years ago , and others restructured to the point that they have become unattractive . U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer . Exxon Corp <XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2 . Chevron Corp <CHV> jumped 1-1/8 to 58-7/8 , and Texaco <TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4 . Unocal Corp <UCL> rose 1-3/4 , while Occidental Petroleum Corp <OXY> climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4 . Amoco Corp <AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4 . Standard Oil 's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to 71-1/8 . Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4 . Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its offer by several dlrs per share , but the company maintained it would not raise the 70 dlr bid . British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8 . Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in the first place indicates that the British oil giant has changed its outlook for the oil industry . Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the more bearish positions on oil prices . " They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs ( a barre l ) for several years , and I think they beat a hasty retreat from that point of view , " Margoshes said . " They are more appropriately today looking more optimistically . I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs ( long-term ) ...also in their heart of hearts they believe that will be exceeded , " Margoshes said . The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel . Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when oil prices were falling last year . They said Standard Oil 's brightest asset is its slightly more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil field . Analysts also said the company has other interests in the Alaskan North Slope . Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and has hard-to-replace reserves . " I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to increase their position in the U.S. market ," Dean Witter analyst Eugene Nowak said . Analysts said it also raises BP 's visibility ahead of the British government 's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP stock . The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding sometime in the year beginning April one . After acquiring all of Standard , most of BP 's reserves would be in the U.S. , but only about six pct of its stock is held in the U.S. " The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it into the United States . No other market can handle all that stock , " said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua . In 1986 , Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs , compared to a profit the year earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs . Reuter

Leigh-Pemberton said in oral evidence to a select committee that " we did not swap numbers we reached an understanding " on how to cooperate towards stabilizing currencies at around their current levels .

Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower , he said " the two half point cuts ( this month in banks ' base lending rates ) have been appropriate up until now .

Base rates are now at 10 pct . Regarding sterling 's relationship with oil , Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall . He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England 's sterling index , when compared with the index 's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level .

the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc <BP> about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses . " We have terminated our discussions , " Roderick told Reuters after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association here . He said USX was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets . Earlier today , BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co 's <SRD> publicly held stock . USX said in December the company had held formal discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies . Roderick , in response to a question , said USX had no immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co , or Texas Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas .

Roderick said Carl Ichan , who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January , continued to hold a sizable interest in the company .

Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community , EC , cereals , sugar and oilseeds sectors , which he said would disrupt these markets . The EC Commission 's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers , he told farmers here . " I give you my word that France , while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion , will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms , " Guillaume told the annual conference of the country 's major farm union , FNSEA ( Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles ) . Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88 . Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months . There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output . But Guillaume 's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets France being a major producer of both crops won him warm applause from the FNSEA 's farmers . His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts , MCA 's , however , are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers . Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission 's proposals to overhaul the farm sector . " The Minister 's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks , " he told reporters , adding that this could also act in Guillaume 's favour on a ministerial level . Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring . Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister . There have been certain advances on cutting production costs , reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid , but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers ' indebtedness , he said . Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs ( 396 mln dlrs ) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire . The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid , Lacombe said . Reuter

raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD> , analysts said . " There 's a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid , " said Rosario Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild . And despite BP managing director David Simon 's denial today that BP would raise the offer , the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility . Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group 's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985 . Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share , after lawsuits by minority shareholders . " I think they 're going to have to go a little higher eventually , just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares , " Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said . He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share . Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984 . After objections from minority shareholders about the price , Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984 . But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer . After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil , Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase . It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake , a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs . The analysts made their comments before Simon 's remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon . Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible . The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share . Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent . But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason , they said .

Last year , the report noted , the cash flow from operations dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices . The report , prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc <BP> disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard 's stock , put 1987 capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs , down from the 1.7 billion dlrs projected in January . Standard 's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in 1986 . The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4 mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985 .

dealer of Herstatt Bank , which collapsed in 1974 on foreign exchange speculation in West Germany 's biggest banking crash , can stand trial for damages , a court ruled . The court overturned a claim by Danny Dattel that a case for damages should not be allowed after such a long interval . Herstatt creditors are seeking 12.5 mln marks from Dat tel , whom they accuse of causing losses at the bank of over 500 mln marks by manipulating forward foreign exchange contracts . The crash of the private Herstatt bank with losses of over one billion marks stunned West Germany 's business community , and led to a tightening of banking regulations . The losses were even greater than the 480 mln marks announced recently by Volkswagen as a result of fraud in currency transactions . Ivan Herstatt , managing director of the bank when it collapsed , was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in 1984 but appealed . Six other people associated with the bank were jailed in 1983 . But Dattel was freed from prosecution after he produced medical evidence of paranoia caused by Nazi persecution during his childhood , which might have led him to take his own life . Reuter

Hernandez Grisanti today told a meeting of regional oil exporters the next few months will be critical to efforts to achieve price recovery and stabilize the market . Hernandez said while OPEC and non-OPEC nations have already made some strides in their efforts to strengthen the market , the danger of a reversal is always present . " M arch and the next two or three months will be a really critical period , " Hernandez said . He said , " We will be able to define a movement , either towards market stability and price recovery or , depending on the market , a reversal . " Earlier this week , Hernandez said Venezuela 's oil price has averaged just above 16 dlrs a barrel for the year to date . If OPEC achieves its stated goal of an 18 dlrs a barrel average price , he said , Venezuela 's should move up to 16.50 dlrs . Hernandez spoke today at the opening of the fifth ministerial meeting of the informal group of Latin American and Caribbean oil exporters , formed in 1983 . Ministers from member states Ecuador , Mexico , Trinidad-Tobago and Venezuela are attending the two day conference , while Colombia is present for the first time as an observer . Hernandez defined the meeting as an informal exchange of ideas about the oil market . However , the members will also discuss ways to combat proposals for a tax on imported oil currently before the U.S. Congress . Following the opening session , the group of ministers met with President Jaime Lusinchi at Miraflores , the presidential palace . The delegations to the conference are headed by Hernandez of Venezuela , Energy Minister Javier Espinosa of Ecuador , Energy Minister Kelvin Ramnath of Trinidad-Tobago , Jose Luis Alcudiai , assistant energy secretary of Mexico and Energy Minister Guilermno Perry Rubio of Colombia .

Council made a recommendation to President Reagan whether to retaliate against Japan for alleged unfair practices in semiconductor trade , U.S. officials said . They would not disclose the council 's recommen dation , but the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call for retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on Japanese exports to the United States . The officials said it might be several days before Reagan would act and his moves made public . The Senate last week unanimously called on Reagan to impose penalities on Japanese exports . Retaliation was also called for by the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union , both hard hit by Japanese semiconductor trade . In a pact last summer , Japan summer agreed to stop dumping its semiconductors at less than cost in the United States and other nations and to open its own market to the U.S. products . In return , the United States agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments . U.S. officials say that while Japan has stopped dumping semiconductors on the American market , they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors . semiconductors on the American market , they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the U.S. semiconductors . reuter

and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows . " I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices , " C.W. Nance , president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production , told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association . Nance predicted that by 1990 , the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity . The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States , he said . " They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979 , " Nance said . He did not say how much of a price hike he expected . Andrew Shoup , chairman of Dallas-based Sabine , predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988 . Natural gas prices , Shoup said , should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988 . " Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand , " Shoup said , referring to the gas industry 's outlook for 1987 . Repeal of the Fuel Use Act , a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities , could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct , he said . Tenneco 's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry 's reduced deliverability . Tenneco 's gas deliverability , for example , dropped by 20 pct during 1986 , he said . " This does not mean the gas bubble is gon e , " Nance said . " We believe gas prices have bottomed out . The real question is how broad the valley is is it one year , two years or three years before we start to climb out ? " J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp> , said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects . " If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails , the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal , " Walter said . He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases . Farm-out agreements , cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel , Walter said . Reuter

indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week 's Federal Open Market Committee ( FOM C ) meeting , economists said . " The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves , indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year , " said Harold Nathan , economist at Wells Fargo Bank . " These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy , " said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. " The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now . There 's no real reason for it to change policy , " said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges . All of the economists agreed that the Fed 's major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks . They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further . Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year . The Fed said that banks ' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period . In the single week to Wednesday , banks ' borrowings at the discount window , less extended credits , averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period . Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct . The Fed 's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some , but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves . The Fed 's absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target , said Liro of Warburg . Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs . The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period . Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs . He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct . It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic , said Wells Fargo 's Nathan . He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band . Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today . More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period . Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs . To partly address this requirement , many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday . A similar coupon " pass " may be required later . There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter . Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31 . Reuter

foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country 's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit , the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) said . By stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year , the U.S. Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system , it said in an annual report . The fundamental problem , the size of the U.S. Federal budget deficit , could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt , it said . GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years . GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings , lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit . Raising U.S. Trade barriers " would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit . It would , however , increase inflation and reduce world trade , " it said . " The basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain , " the report said . GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar , risk of higher U.S. Inflation , concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism . The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan , West Germany and the U.S. Had increased in 1986 . The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies , it added . " Th us the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year , " the report said . GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the U.S. Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar . " Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates , which , in turn , would adversely affect world trade . " But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States , despite the dollar 's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive . It suggested that resources idle in the U.S. , Both human and in underutilised factories , were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad . World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986 , about half of the rate of the previous year . Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct , continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade , GATT said . Developing countries ' exports declined significantly , while their imports increased moderately , although full statistics are not available yet , GATT said . The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower , and only five of them ( Chile , Colombia , Philippines , South Korea , and Thailand ) had higher exports . REUTER

Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement , industry sources said . They would give no details , noting that the White House had not commented on the decision . The administration has been under pressure to retaliate . There was no immediate announcement on the council 's decision , but U.S. Officials said it was likely the senior policy group 's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices . U.S. Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so , after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation . The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors . Under a pact reached last July , Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to U.S.-made semiconductors . In return , the U.S. Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments . The United States said that dumping has stopped in the U.S. Market but has continued in third countries , and that the Japanese market remains closed . The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors . A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union . U.S. Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods , such as televisions , video cassette recorders and computers . REUTER

countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange . Wheat , tobacco , tea , coffee , jute , engineering and electronic goods , as well as minerals including iron ore , are all on offer in return for crude oil , petroleum products , chemicals , steel and machinery , trade sources told Reuters . Most of the impetus behind countertrade , which began in 1984 , comes from two state trading firms the State Trading Corp ( ST C ) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp ( MMTC ) . " The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports , " a commerce ministry spokeswoman said , adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading . One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports . However , countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India 's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December , the sources said . Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India 's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March , against almost nothing in 1984/85 , official figures show . However , the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees , the sources said . Total trade with the Soviet Union , involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil , is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87 , against three billion in 1985/86 . Indian countertrade , which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country 's large trade deficit , is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia , Venezuela and Brazil , the trade sources said . The trade deficit , which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86 , is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year . But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors , including the slow growth of foreign reserves , a tight debt repayment schedule , shrinking aid and trade protectionism , businessmen said . One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past , when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules . As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , India cannot officially support bartering . The MMTC 's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails . " MMTC 's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India , " a trade official said , adding that the policy remains flexible . " We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India , " the trade official said . Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft , ships , drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return , the trade sources said . Illustrating the point , the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission . In return , the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract , against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi , the trade official said . " We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest , " he added . Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods . India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods , including jute bags and cars . But despite India 's new drive , countertrade has some inherent problems , they added . " It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced , " one trade source said . " The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants . " Another added , " Barter is also restrictive . We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty . " This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India . It does not even figure in the country 's foreign trade policy . " REUTER

Michel Girardin , DRI Europe 's senior economist , said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year " will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment .

DRI forecast that inflation , which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986 , will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct . Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year 's 22 pct appreciation . An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency , he said .

monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action . " The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly , " Jardine Fleming ( Securities ) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said . The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago . The current account surplus , which includes trade in services as well as goods , climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago . After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations , the figures look a bit better , but not much . On that basis , the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January . " In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength , " said William Stirling , economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper . "On a seasonally adjusted basis , we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down , " Jardine 's Rasmussen said . But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish , he said . Finance Ministry officials blamed last month 's slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January . The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month , after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January . This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports , they said . But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan 's trading partners . REUTER

markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank 's policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy . While agreeing with the Bank 's commitment to defend the guilder strongly , some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System ( EMS ) . Roelof Nelissen , chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV ( Amro ) said the Central Bank 's policy was overcautious . " I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS, " Nelissen said at the presentation of Am ro 's 1986 annual report last week . Within the EMS , the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100 . The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100 . It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target , using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate . The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands . Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short . Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin "By maintaining the 113.00 limit , the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level . If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain . " Am ro 's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market . Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilde r /mark exchange rate , he added . Unlike Am ro , Algemene Bank Nederland NV ( ABN ) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay . It fully agrees with the Central Bank 's policy , director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters , noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency . " It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate , " he added . Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries , as the economic performance of the two does not differ much , economists said . Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released , but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries , put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month . Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates . West Germany is the Netherla nds ' largest single trading partner , taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986 , Central Bureau of Statistics figures show . At the moment , the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5- 7/16 pct . Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987 , contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany . In the Netherlands , the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct , the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month . German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct , but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct , according to most German forecasts . But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates , money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank . Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22 , the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge . Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally , they said . The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted . While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies , the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow . " The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark . Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency , " Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said . " If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper , the markets would start to believe it was weak . We do n't want that . We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark , " he said . REUTER

" Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World , " he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics . " I would be pleased with additional support . " With 25 pct of the world 's total banking assets , Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads , bridges and other infrastructure , he said . Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan 's advantage . It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies notably those in South America , China and India that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world , he said . Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank 's concessionary lending affiliate , the International Development Association ( IDA ) . It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) , Conable noted . Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans , designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade .

visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting U.S. Anger over Japanese trade policies , but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim . Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans , Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell U.S. President Ronald Reagan and key U.S. Congressmen , they said . News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 8.14 billion dlr trade surplus last month , more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier . It also came one day after the Reagan Administration 's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips . Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages one designed to pep up Japan 's sagging economy and imports in the short-term , the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth . But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day . Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate . But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan . Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the U.S. Virtually empty-handed , Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) to come up with its own measures . He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government 's plans , without losing face in parliament over the budget , political analysts said . Officials working on the government 's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations , deregulation , measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices , and accelerated public investment . They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half , probably over 80 pct . Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan , who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit . To complement the short-term measures , Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan 's longer-term economic plans . A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington . Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa 's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy , officials said . While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible , they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee 's recommendations . A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring , officials said . The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan 's total output , or gross national product , around 1993 or 1995 . Last year the surplus , which measures trade in goods and services , amounted to over four pct of gnp . The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen , to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 , from 150 now .

countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange . Wheat , tobacco , tea , coffee , jute , engineering and electronic goods , as well as minerals including iron ore , are all on offer in return for crude oil , petroleum products , chemicals , steel and machinery , trade sources told Reuters . Most of the impetus behind countertrade , which began in 1984 , comes from two state trading firms the State Trading Corp ( ST C ) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp ( MMTC ) . " The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports , " a commerce ministry spokeswoman said , adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading . One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports . However , countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India 's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December , the sources said . Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India 's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March , against almost nothing in 1984/85 , official figures show . However , the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees , the sources said . Total trade with the Soviet Union , involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil , is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87 , against three billion in 1985/86 . Indian countertrade , which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country 's large trade deficit , is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia , Venezuela and Brazil , the trade sources said . The trade deficit , which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86 , is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year . But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors , including the slow growth of foreign reserves , a tight debt repayment schedule , shrinking aid and trade protectionism , businessmen said . One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past , when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules . As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , India cannot officially support bartering . The MMTC 's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails . " MMTC 's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India , " a trade official said , adding that the policy remains flexible . " We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India , " the trade official said . Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft , ships , drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return , the trade sources said . Illustrating the point , the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission . Reuter

against yen today , a spokesman for the bank said . He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when precisely it intervened . Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National Bank 's purchases as modest , perhaps amounting to no more than 20 or 30 mln dlrs . The Bank of France , which was reported buying dollars against the yen in Paris , had made inquiries with Swiss banks as well , and the Bundesbank had also intervened . Bank of Japan dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs . Dealers said this tended to confirm the market 's impression that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen , and the market seemed ready to test it . Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew closer . Today 's dealings in spot currencies are booked for March 31 . One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this point , but some , while sticking to the letter of that request , were offering dollars forward today , rather than lose out if the dollar fell further . The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting in Hamburg .

said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea . Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens " the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours ( Turkey ) were to carry out military actions . " He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean . " The air force , navy and army are in a state of alert , " General Guven Ergenc , Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff , told a news conference . He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1 , escorted by an unspecified number of warships , would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning . Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area . The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey . Greece and Turkey have long-s tanding disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus . The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover . Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests " because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements . " Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels , he said " If there is an attack , it is clear what has to be done . An attack on a warship is a cause for war . " But he added " We are not in a state of war . The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights . " Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague . Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached . In Athens , Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations " we will hinder it , of course not with words , as it cannot be stopped with words . " Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean . But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move , saying only " The Greek fleet is not at its naval base . " Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf . Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey , the Greek government would not accept it . Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus . He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here . Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war , Papandreou replied " O bviously , and perhaps even before the war . " REUTER

licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London 's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan 's markets to foreign competition , government sources said . " We ca n't say " yes , we are going to do it ( rev oke licences ) " but this is definitely being considered , " an official said . His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan . Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices . " There 's a sense of urgency here now , but the emphasis is on securing not undermining our interests in Japan ," another government official told Reuters . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access . She clearly had Japan in mind , government sources said . The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7 billion stg , official figures show . A parliamentary motion , signed by 98 MPs , today urged the U.K. Government to " coordinate action with the President of the United States , and through the Department of Trade and Industry , to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications , and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences " until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called " restrictive conditions " on the bid by ( Cable and Wireless PLC ) ( cawl .L ) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan 's international telecommunications market . The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs , reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament . Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action . Officials said another option now being considered by the U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions . That could be done under the government 's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament . 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London , of which 29 are banks . In Tokyo , 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business , officials said . The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements . " The Financial Services Act gives ( Trade and Industry Secretary Paul ) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment , banking and insurance , " one official said . " This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times , " the official added . Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan , but by working within EC treaties , another official said . British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan . " There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer , " he said , adding " (such barriers ) ca n't be put in place overnight . " Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade " strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market ( Japan ) which is itself in a very dominant position ( in ) certain aspects of our own domestic market It is really a question of fairness . " The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan 's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February , year-on-year , to 8.14 billion dlrs from 5.7 billion in January , political sources said . But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate . Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions , it would most likely focus on the smaller , rather than larger ones , to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre , government sources said . Japan 's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange . In Washington , White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States . There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week . Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors . REUTER

Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce short-term debt incurred last December when the company purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group .

The new privately held company , named Honeywell Bull , is 42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc , 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by NEC , the new company said . Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over half its shares to Bull . Book value at the time will determine the move 's pricing , Honeywell said . Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer , Edson Spencer , said the move is the last major step in Honeywell 's restructuring . "As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and controls for buildings , industry , aerospace and defense , Honeywell is now focusing its management , technical and financial resources on high market share business ," Spencer said . Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull 's largest customer , purchasing computers for its own internal data processing , for integration into Honeywell buidling and industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S. governement . Honeywell said HIS 's Federal Systems Division is now a wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc , and has been named Honeywell Federal Systems Inc. Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued operation in 1986 , and will account for its future interest on a cost basis , recording any dividends as received . Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product line and build its business in integrated systems for networking , database management and transaction processing . The new company said its board will have nine members , including the chairman and chief executive officer . Bull will have four members , Honeywell two and NEC one , the new company , which began worldwide operations today , said .

widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states , a USDA official said . All counties in Iowa will be affected , as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois , Indiana , Tennessee , Kentucky , Missouri , Mississippi , Arkansas , Alabama and Louisiana , said Ron Burgess , Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA. USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately , all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts , depending on what the differential is . USDA 's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices . " We 've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month , and we do n't think it 's going to get back in line in any nearby time ," Burgess said . Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede . " If we 're off the mark now because we 're too high , would n't we be as much off the mark if we 're too low ? " he said . While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall , Burgess said no other changes in USDA 's price system are being planned right now . " We do n't tinker .

The report said to compensate for the below normal precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of fertilizer . While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible , most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore has emerged from dormancy and is doing well , the report said .

prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from continued weakness in the U.S. dollar , analysts said . " There 's been a tug of war between the ( currency ) speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it looks like the game has gone to the speculators , " said John Ing at Maison Placements Canada Inc. The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central banks , including the Federal Reserve , dealers said . A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the traditional hedge against uncertainty , Ing noted . Another analyst , Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd , noted that " a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars . If they see they are losing money , they move back into gold . " A dollar decline also has inflationary implications , Ing said , adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct . Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce . Cohen sees an average price of 425 dlrs , and another analyst , Michael Pickens , at Yorkton Securities , puts the average at 450 dlrs , with a possible spike above 500 dlrs . However , gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself , causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere in the future . But for now , all analysts say there is no sign the buying pressure is slowing down . " The stocks have run an incredible way , " Cohen said . On U.S. markets today , ASA Ltd <ASA > rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2 , Campbell Red Lake Mines <CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold <NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4 .

Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct since December 31 , 1986 , while the price of bullion has increased six pct . " Canadian golds have been the top performing index this year , " he noted . In the U.S. , there is " too much money chasing too few stocks ," Pickens said .

Some of the crop is far enough along so that it 's probably vulnerabl e , " Krenzler said . Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20 's fahrenheit as early as tonight , depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system . If impeded by the low-pressure area , the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning . Temperatures could stay in the mid-20 's for up to eight hours , Mohler said . Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage . The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather , he said . " We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees ( fahrenheit )," Krenzler said , " as long as we do n't have a lot of wind . " " If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I 'd say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads , " he said .

Taiwan 's reserves have resulted largely from its trade surplus , which hit 15.6 billion dlrs in 1986 and 10.6 billion in 1985 . About 95 pct of the surplus was from Taiwan 's trade with the United States , according to official figures . But he said that while easing the controls would help reduce the reserves , it would not do so substantially in a short time . Economists and bankers said the new decision resulted from growing pressure from the United States , Taiwan 's largest trading partner , which buys almost half the island 's exports . Lu Ming-Jen , economic professor at Soochow University , told Reuters " The decision came a little bit late . But it was better than never . " Ko Fei-Lo , Vice President at First Commercial Bank , said the government should rapidly relax its foreign exchange controls and open its market wider to help balance trade with its trading partners , especially the United States . " The liberalisation in both imports and foreign exchange controls will not only help our trading partners , but also help our own economic problems , " he said . He said the mounting foreign exchange reserveshelped boost Taiwan 's money supply by 48.22 pct in the year to end-February . REUTER

angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on trade in computer microchips . Electronic Industries Association of Japan ( EIAJ ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated " EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement . " " We urge U.S. Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made , to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement , and to resist emotional biases , " he said . Yesterday , Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan 's failure to comply with the terms of the pact . The agreement , struck late last year after months of heated negotiations , called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors . To salvage the pact , Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports . Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join . " This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the Japanese market ," he said . REUTER

was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels . Kurt Viermetz , Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co> , told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis . Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association , Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered . " I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround ( rise ) in the dollar , " Viermetz said . " I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987 . " The United States , West Germany , Japan , France , Great Britain and Canada G-6 agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels . The accord came after months of transatlantic argument , with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington 's policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters . The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances . But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty 's economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan the U.S. Trade deficit would improve only temporarily . He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990 , it would be back around 160 billion dlrs . " This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington , " he said . Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord , struck when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen . Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or " Plaza Accord , " the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240 yen . Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a " loose rang e " of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 145 to 155 yen , with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention . The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years . It closed at 1.8160/70 marks . Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar . But at the same time , worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world . The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres . Formal discussions , which end today , have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets , with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of business . Hikmat Nashashibi , President of the Arab Bankers Association , said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking . REUTER

Meguerditch Bouldikian called for the establishment of an Arab fund to assist the Lebanese pound , which has lost more than 80 pct of its value against the dollar since January 1986 . Bouldikian told an Arab exchange dealers conference the bank would continue to take measures to defend the currency . But he said Lebanon needed foreign support for its war-battered economy now more than ever before . " We expect a common effort between the central bank and Arab central banks and monetary authorities to create an Arab fund to support and preserve the value of the currency when needed , " he said . Twelve years of civil war have devastated productive sectors of the Lebanese economy and created gaping trade and budget deficits . Bouldikian said recent government measures had succeeded in reducing demand for imports and increasing exports . " These are encouraging factors , but the war has not ended yet , " he said . " We believe that with a just political solution acceptable to all sides , confidence will return and this will benefit the Lebanese pound and Lebanon . " In the meantime , he said the central bank had four main goals 1 ) to use surplus liquidity to finance the budget deficit 2 ) to increase the role of commercial banks and non-bank financing institutions in financing the deficit 3 ) to limit the transfer of Lebanese pounds into foreign currency deposits 4 ) to protect the financial health of commercial banks .

a conciliatory note in Japan 's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips . " Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected , " he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying . While expressing regret over America 's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods , Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute . Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after , just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect . Tokyo is expected to propose a joint U.S./Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets . Yesterday , Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo 's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact . That agreement , hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations , called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips . Nakasone 's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister , Hajime Tamura , who earlier today said Japan was ready to take " appropriate measures " if Washington went ahead with the sanctions . Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura 's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue . But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT , the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade , if Washington imposed the tariffs . Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , they said . If that article were invoked , GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the U.S. Action . But officials here said they hope that can be avoided . " It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date , " Tamura said . In announcing the U.S. Sanctions yesterday , President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports . Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work . They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output . While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips , MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens . The Ministry recently called on Japan 's major chip users , some of whom are also leading producers , to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors . A spokesman for one of the companies , Toshiba Corp < TSBA.T> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so .

oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed waters . A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory . A Greek-based international consortium , North Aegean Petroleum Co. , Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island , it said . " In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters , " the statement added . An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute . It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises , he was quoted as saying .

predicted a modest economic recovery in the Gulf Arab states following higher oil revenues . A bank study , carried by the Emirates news agency WAM , said total oil revenues of the six Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) countries were likely to reach 39 billion dlrs this year from 33.5 billion in 1986 . The GCC groups Bahrain , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) . The bank said the improvement would result from higher oil prices made possible by last December 's OPEC accord to restrain overall group production . These curbs have pushed up oil prices from around eight dollars a barrel in mid-198 6 to around 18 dlrs . " All signs point to the possibility of a modest recovery in the economies of these ( GCC ) countries , although this expected growth will not be similar to that of the ( 1970s ) boom years ," the study said . It added , however , that GCC states would experience higher budget deficits this year because of needs arising from past recession and the difficulty of making fresh spending cuts . The study said the combined GCC bugdet deficits would rise to 23.2 billion dlrs from 17.9 billion last year . It said lower oil exports cut the GCC states ' combined trade surplus to 18 billion dlrs in 1986 from 21.5 billion in 1985 . The UAE suffered a 19.5 pct drop in gross domestic product to 77.6 billion dirhams last year from 96.4 billion in 1985 , it added . REUTER

economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal of a unified currency system , the President of the Arab Bankers Association said . Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an Arab currency traders meeting " We have to start with coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common system of currencies There is quite a substantial way to go yet . " He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a plausible project . The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Bahrain , Oman , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have held a series of meetings this year to examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary System ( EMS ) . At present , five currencies are linked either officially or in practice to the U.S. Dollar , while the Kuwaiti dinar is pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies . A common currency system or EMS-style " grid " would , in theory , foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable exchange rates , but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain small . " Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their infancy , " he said . Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks , a paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that often does not recognise the western banking concept of interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets .

chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war , government officials said . " We hope that the dispute on this specific issue wo n't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States , " a Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) official said . On Friday , Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo 's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact . That agreement , reached last year after heated negotiations , called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors . Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone 's planned trip to Washington at the end of April . While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working , the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip 's success , they said . " The perception of Japan in the ( U.S. ) Congress is very bad , " one official told Reuters . " We would very much like to do something to respond to that . " In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas , MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers , not to the government . Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress , the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute , trade analysts said . They said that it was an open secret that Japan 's largest chip maker , NEC Corp , was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact , included enforced production cuts . The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action . " Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement , " said Shoichi Saba , Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan . He accused the U.S. Of being " irrational . " He said the U.S. Action had made the bilateral chip pact " meaningless . " Saba 's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone , who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations . Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17 .

talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac 's first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade . " The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past , the trade war did n't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism , " one U.S. Official told Reuters . " It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect , more harmonious than usual . " Since taking office a year ago , Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States . During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April , France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory , forcing them to take a circuitous route . That angered Washington . The U.S. O fficials , who asked not to be identified , said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism . " Now they are . We 're pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased , " one said . More recently , a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community threatened to become a trade war . In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain , the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute . Last week , the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad , supported , trained and armed by Paris and Washington , scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad . A French official added " There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets . " Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries , many irritants remain . At the top of the list is the Community 's common agricultural policy ( CAP ) .

again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth , officials and businessmen from around the world said . As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen , making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder , Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise . The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April , last year . The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa . It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses , Japan must " make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation 's lifes tyle . There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation . " Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change . But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short , or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits . The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week . The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact . British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture . On Friday , European currency dealers said European central banks , annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade pract ises , might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen . Eishiro Saito , head of top Japanese business group Keidanren , spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community . " Related to this matter of ( trade ) imbalance , the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report , " he said . " We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand ...Would take time ," Saito said . Saito 's words were ignored . In February , EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said " I only know that your government , under the leadership of Maekawa , points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking , more inward looking one . It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe . " And Europeans and Americans want quick action . " A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy , the kind suggested by the Maekawa report . And we hope to see changes occur in the near future , " visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March . Such expectations are now ingrained , which was partly the fault of Nakasone , who heralded Maekawa 's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs , said U.S. O fficials . Months before the report was issued , U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem . " We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action , " said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock . " The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour , " said Philip Caldwell , Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers . Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance . Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can , said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue . He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report , including restructuring of the coal and steel industries . A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy . Europeans are confused about this , underlined by von Moltke 's reference to the " leadership " of the Maekawa report . Even so , Japanese officials point to last September 's government programme of new economic measures . " Without endorsing the report as policy , officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report , " the ambassador said . REUTER

impact of falling oil prices , kept inflation within limits and boosted exports , Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said . Indonesia was badly hit by last year 's steep plunge in crude prices , which cut revenue from oil exports by half . But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in the financial year ending tomorrow , against around 4.3 pct the previous year . Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct , he said , although he did not give complete figures . The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general elections next month in Indonesia , a major producer of rubber , palm oil , tin , timber and coffee . Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against the dollar , which increased Indonesia 's debt repa yments . He said the economy would have suffered more from the world economic recession if the government had not devalued the rupiah by 31 pct last September . In an editorial on the economic outlook , the Jakarta Post said the government must press ahead with measures to deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports . The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were needed to finance not only imports but also the country 's growing foreign debt , estimated at around 37 billion dlrs . " A bout 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due within the next three to five years and will steadily increase the debt servicing burden , " the paper said . However , end-investors were seen bargain hunting in expectation of a further yen interest rate decline , dealers said . Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar 's nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate rebound to halt further dollar depreciation . A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this afternoon were taken favourably by the market . REUTER

little new to offer to settle a dispute with the U.S. Over computer chips , trade analysts and government officials said . The U.S. Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the U.S. , In retaliation for Japan 's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September . A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters " Japan has done what it can , and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect . " The U.S. Alleges that , in defiance of the September agreement , Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-U.S. Markets and refusing to open Japan further to U.S. Chip sales . U.S. Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17 . Analysts noted Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices . " I 'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has , " said Jardine Fleming ( Securities ) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards . A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought , although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods . Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more U.S. Chips . But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely . Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs , which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves . " If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time , there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States , " said Tom Murtha , analyst at James Capel and Co. " The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether , but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year , " he said . Some analysts said tariffs would also harm U.S. Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors U.S. Firms are trying to sell here . " The American approach is full of contradictions , " Jardine Fleming 's Edwards said . " If they want to expand ( U.S. ) exports , the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market ," Edwards said . But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just U.S. Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry , but also frustration with Japan 's vast trade surplus . Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact . Carole Ryavec , an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd , said " The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent econom y . " REUTER

money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island 's newly launched treasury bill programme . The Bahrain Monetary Agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from April 1 which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills , or through discounting them . The circular , released officially to Reuters , said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except " in quite exceptional circumstances . " Under the current system , the agency provides the island 's 20 commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short-term swaps against U.S. Dollars and , less frequently , by short-term loans secured against government development bonds . " The agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short-term assistance based on Government of Bahrain treasury bills , " the circular to banks states . The agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge . The agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days . Bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of 91-day treasury bills in mid-December last year and has since raised a total of 26 mln dinars through the programme . Bahrain 's commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency . But banking sources said the new regime from April 1 will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank . Banking sources said more than half of the 20 banks hold treasury bills , although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly . Last week 's yield was six pct , although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as 5.60 pct . Banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps . But a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the U.S. Currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord . REUTER

The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options , Giordano said . Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day . Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity , he said . The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies , including a new Australian dollar option , and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs . Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract , which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option , with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily . Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities , set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading , increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house , he said .

again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth , officials and businessmen from around the world said . As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen , making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder , Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise . The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April , last year . The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa . It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses , Japan must " make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation 's lifes tyle . There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation . " Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change . But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short , or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits . The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week . The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact . British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture . On Friday , European currency dealers said European central banks , annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade pract ises , might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen . Eishiro Saito , head of top Japanese business group Keidanren , spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community . " Related to this matter of ( trade ) imbalance , the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report , " he said . " We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand ...Would take time ," Saito said . Saito 's words were ignored . In February , EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said " I only know that your government , under the leadership of Maekawa , points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking , more inward looking one . It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe . " And Europeans and Americans want quick action . " A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy , the kind suggested by the Maekawa report . And we hope to see changes occur in the near future , " visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March . Such expectations are now ingrained , which was partly the fault of Nakasone , who heralded Maekawa 's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs , said U.S. O fficials . Months before the report was issued , U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem . " We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action , " said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock . " The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour , " said Philip Caldwell , Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers . Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance . Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can , said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue . He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report , including restructuring of the coal and steel industries . A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy . Europeans are confused about this , underlined by von Moltke 's reference to the " leadership " of the Maekawa report . Even so , Japanese officials point to last September 's government programme of new economic measures . " Without endorsing the report as policy , officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report , " the ambassador said . REUTER

a leading trader of currency options , plans to extend its trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets , exchange president Nicholas Giordano said . He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between 1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third quarter this year . The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve clients in the region and educate financial markets about the advantages of currency options , Giordano said . Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the exchange-trade currency option market against existing over-the-counter option trading during the local working day . Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and had grown in popularity , he said . The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies , including a new Australian dollar option , and traded an average 42,000 contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30 billion U.S. Dlrs . Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the performance of its Australian dollar contract , which since its introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as the third most popular traded option , with up to 8,000 contracts traded daily . Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities , set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading , increase arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries access to a currency option market of much greater depth and liquidity with the security of a clearing house , he said .

said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar . Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate , he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy . He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year . Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation , with money supply growth accelerating , he said . Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices , exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan . Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far , Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar . But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar 's fall , he said . The dollar 's steep fall stems from the market 's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand , he said .

chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale trade war , government officials said . " We hope that the dispute on this specific issue wo n't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States , " a Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) official said . On Friday , Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo 's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact . That agreement , reached last year after heated negotiations , called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors . Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone 's planned trip to Washington at the end of April . While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working , the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip 's success , they said . " The perception of Japan in the ( U.S. ) Congress is very bad , " one official told Reuters . " We would very much like to do something to respond to that . " In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas , MITI officials sought to depict the U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers , not to the government . Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress , the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute , trade analysts said . They said that it was an open secret that Japan 's largest chip maker , NEC Corp , was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact , included enforced production cuts . The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action . " Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the U.S./Japan agreement , " said Shoichi Saba , Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan . He accused the U.S. of being " irrational . " He said the U.S. action had made the bilateral chip pact " meaningless . " Saba 's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone , who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations . Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17 . Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of U.S. chips and to propose a joint investigation into U.S. allegations of chip dumping . Reuter

to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade , top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar . Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides , Assistant Secretary David Mulford , said last week there was no target for the dollar , a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar , despite massive central bank intervention . " That was no slip of the tongue , " said one western monetary official , who asked not to be identified . For now , the strategy appears to be working . Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April . Until last week , there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon . The Reagan administration , facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit , is learning now that to extract results from Japan , dramatic action is required . Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries . The shift in U.S. strategy , in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies , comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies . And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action , in the view of U.S. officials . Nonetheless , U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the deficit . "I 'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits ( from the lower doll ar ) soon , " said one . In Paris , leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting " underlying economic fundament al s " or economic reality . The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit . The three nations , joined by France , Britain and Canada , agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances . But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar , rather than a stable one . Markets , in effect , are less confident than governments that these measures including U.S. budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out . Nonetheless , the dollar 's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation . A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem " to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for . " International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers , although Japan is an obvious exception . " Everybody feels it can still be managed , " one source said of market developments . But last week , the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen , and other central banks about one billion dlrs . Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America 's half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar , flouting the Paris accord outright . The source , close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking , said Japan 's understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar , the level it stood at when the accord was struck . The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington 's use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies . It was a " pointed reminder " to Japan to do something about the trade issues , the source said of the dollar 's fall against the yen . By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels Baker triggered a run on the dollar . Later in the week , Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth . But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement . " There 's a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone , everyone agrees that the external ( trade ) imbalances ought to be adjusted , " one official said . " While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty , we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation , " another U.S. official said . The officials said the meeting here , where the six will be joined by Italy , will be a status report . " Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans . Maybe there 's a need to move faster , " one source said . Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called , in effect , for currency stability for several months . This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit . His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U.S. trade deficit .

Baldrige , referring to the U.S.-Japan trade agreement on semiconductors , said " Their government wants to live up to it .

" " I think the Japanese understand full well that they have n't lived up to this commitment , " he said . He added " I do not think there will be a trade war at all . " On Friday , Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17 , because of Tokyo 's failure to observe the agreement . The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement . But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs . Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong U.S. Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted . He denied the action had been taken for that reason . REUTER

General Acquisition Co , comprising investors Wagner and Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries , also reiterated its willingness to negotiate with Gencorp . The partnership has earlier offered 100 dlrs per share for GenCorp a tire , broadcasting , plastics and aerospace conglommerate .

Gencorp said its statement would be made on or before the company 's annual meeting , scheduled for Tuesday . General Acquisition made its statement in a letter sent to the GenCorp board on Friday . The partnership said it was willing to negotiate all points of its offer , including price . The group the board cannot fully carry out its fiduciary duties to GenCorp shareholders and make a fully informed decision about its offer until it has " thoroughly explored with us the ways in which our offer can be revised to provide greater value to your shareholders . " General Acquisition said it is aware the board may be reviewing alternative transactions which might provide GenCorp shareholders with a payment other than cash . " If that is the case , you should recognize that our additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide in any similarly structured transaction , " the partnership said . General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp 's board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for competing offers . The partnership requested that if any other proposal is under consideration that it be given the same information available to GenCorp 's managers and advisers in constructing a proposal . General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision is made . General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp remove its " poison pill " or shareholders rights plan . General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an " environment for fair competition , " it will take all steps necessary to create such an envir oment . It said it may take legal action or seek the support of shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board and to consider other proposals it might develop .

withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased . A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday , avoiding a potential clash . Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday . The Greek government later withdrew Friday 's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri , north of Athens , saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid . Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord , Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened . The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean . Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled . Athens says it considers the accord inactive . The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters . Greece declined comment on the statement . Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-s tanding continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague .

the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency 's appreciation to prove temporary , senior officials said . " The market has already located a ceiling ( for the yen ) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit , " one senior Finance Ministry official said . He attributed the dollar 's fall in recent days to special factors , in particular , selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year . That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here , the senior official said . " They ( the investors ) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock ( 0100 GMT ) ," he said . After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning , the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20 . Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen . Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar 's recent sharp fall . One official even called the market 's recent actions irrational . If anything , the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S. , He said . As a result , several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month 's meeting of major nations in Paris .

They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today , and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies , a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said . The dollar 's plunge and low yields on U.S. Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments , as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets , securities bond managers said . They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in U.S. Bonds but many have lightened their U.S. Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct . Since late last year , Japanese investors , seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields , have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and , after the Paris currency pact , actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening U.S. Bond inventories , the managers said . Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well . The yield of the key 5.1 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4.080 pct today from the 4.140 Saturday finish and compared with 4.25 pct on three-month certificates of deposit . The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here , suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains , dealers said . A market survey by Reuters showed some active accounts in U.S. Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo 's stock market . The stock market 's bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from U.S. Treasuries , dealers said . Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 7.7 billion for the whole of 1986 , Finance Ministry sources said .

for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country 's worst drought in 36 years , government officials said . Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka 's population in 13 districts . The letter said the government had to step in " to avert serious economic hardship " and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas . The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period , at least until the May-September ( Yala ) rice crop was harvested . Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat , rice , flour and other cereals were required , it said , along with supplies of sugar , lentils , dried or canned fish and milk . In some of the most seriously affected districts , the Maha ( October 1986-April 1987 ) crop had been " almost completely devastated , " the letter said . Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels , 20 mln less than originally expected . There were two scenarios for the Yala crop , with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks . " S hould the present drought continue , however , production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels , " the letter added . Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels , or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice . Last year 's output was 124 mln bushels , down from 127 mln in 1985 . The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed . It said the government 's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected . " Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy . Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side . " The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family , as well as handling , transport and distribution of emergency food . But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects , or " greatly fuelling inflation " in the economy , the letter said . The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements " provided such stocks are replaced subsequently . " The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May . The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August , and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986 . Reuter

with its enormous worldwide trade surplus , the symbol of the U.S. trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America 's record trade deficit . " Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade the challenge to our high technology industries , the threat of government nutured competition , and the multitude of barriers to our exports , " Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said . " If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems , we can manage our difficulties with other countrie s , " the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill . Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright , a Texas Democrat , have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month . Japan 's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year . Its surplus rose to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion dlrs in January . Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar 's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more U.S. goods . They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in U.S. exports of sophisticated computer technology . In response to the growing anger and pressure by the U.S. semiconductor industry , President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan 's failure to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor agreement . Congress also has been been angered by the administration 's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef , citrus , automobile parts , telecommunications goods , and financial services . The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees . It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition . Although most provisions do not single out Japan , in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties . The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2 . Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for U.S. industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports . The most controversial issue , an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more U.S. goods was left for an April vote by the House . Rep. Richard Gephardt , a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri , has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment . The measure would have the most impact on Japan , West Germany , Taiwan and South Korea . If Japan , for example , does not reduce its barriers by mid-198 8 , the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years . " I 'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me , 'We 're not over competing in Japan because we ca n't compete in the marketplace . ' That argument needs to be taken away from American business ," Gephardt said . The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision .

Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies . Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands , Lawson replied , " we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to . " When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris , Lawson said " I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement , so as not to make it easy for " speculation against the accord . Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors . But if such movements were due to extraneous factors , Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges . " It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented , just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented , " Lawson said . In his oral evidence to Parliament 's Select Treasury Committee , Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound 's current level , adding that " It is an objective To try to keep it around that level . " He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices , largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully . " There has been a reassessment of sterling 's fundamental s , " Lawson said . He disagreed with what he termed " the grossly exaggerated claim " that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries . Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London , Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average . Lawson confirmed that " over the medium and longer term , the government 's objective is zero inflation . " He said the government 's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP " is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine . " He added that " to allow the debt/GD P ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation . " Reuter

reduce operations if they want to be profitable this year , said industry officials attending the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting here . " If the refining sector can discipline itself to refine about 12 mln barrels of crude oil a day , we have a chance to pull down inventories to acceptable levels by the second quarter , said Archie Dunham , executive vice president of petroluem products at Conoco Inc " If not , the industry will have a tough 1987 , " he added . Last week 's American Petroleum Institute report said that U.S. refining capacity rose three pct to 78.7 pct of capacity , with crude oil runs at 12.2 mln barrels per day for the week ended March 20 . The API said that with the higher crude oil runs , distillate and gasoline inventories were sharply above year-ago levels . Gasoline stocks were at 245.6 mln barrels , some 17.2 mln barrels above year-ago levels . Distillate stocks , at 108.7 mln barrels , are 10.9 mln barrels above last year 's level , the API said . Henry Rosenberg , chairman of Crown Central Petroleum Corp <C NP > told Reuters that unless refining and marketing return to profitability , oil companies will have to rely on downstream operations to produce an acceptable level of earnings . " The jump in refining capacity is a concern if it continues , " said Kenneth Buckler , executive vice president of refining and marketing at <Total Petroleum Co> , a U.S. subsidiary of Cie Francaise Des Petroles of France . Refineries should operate near 75 pct of capacity given the current level of demand but the operating level should increase as gasoline demand picks up in the next quarter , Buckler said . Dunham said the potential operable capacity of U.S. refineries should also be cut about 500,000 barrels of crude per day . " I expect to see the shutdown of more small refineries over the next five years ," he said , adding that these facilities refine between 10,000 and 30,000 barrels of crude oil per day .

said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products . Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against U.S. exports , Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied , " That would be the height of foolishness . " In addition , he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17 . Japan 's 58.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs U.S. trade deficit in 1986 . President Reagan 's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress . " I think it 's about time ," Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters . House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session , " It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing . " Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday 's U.S. trade action would help U.S. negotiations on access to Japan for U.S. auto parts . Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more U.S.-made automotive parts . Last year , Japan racked up a 3.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products . Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987 . " It 's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised . I hope it will persuade them we 're serious , " Smart said of the White House trade sanctions . The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers . " All we ask is a chance . We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be , " he said . Measured per car , each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in U.S. auto parts , Smart said . Reuter

monetary policy , begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986 , will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter , analysts said . A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower , with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy . " The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession , " said Raymond Stone , chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut . But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point , to avoid hurting the dollar further . All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged . The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield , to 7-1/2 pct , and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another , to 5- 7/8 pct . Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct . Other broad predictions of the survey , relating mainly to the April-June quarter , follow The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget deficit and a wide , but narrowing , trade gap . Contacted after the dollar 's steep drop in the last two business days , the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more , rather than less , than they expect . Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range . Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 . Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise . The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up . Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986 . The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation , as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year . U.S. real gross national product , which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half , should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves . First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate , slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter . Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. He expects real GNP , which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986 , to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter . " The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect , " Brusca said . He said an involuntary buildup in inventories , largely in autos , will add to first-quarter economic growth , with consumer spending helping later . " We 're running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat , " said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest . Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth , respectively . He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative . Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories , lower capital investment , slow government spending and less construction . Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth . He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds , with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct , respectively . Nikko 's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds , 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate . Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar 's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan . David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct . Raul Nicho , president of Money Market Services Inc , lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds . Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct . The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S. trade sanctions . Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers . ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS ..Fed funds ..Prime. . Nikko Securities .....8.25 ......6.15 ......7.75..

Transportation ( DOT ) said it gave final clearance to the proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American Airlines Inc. " The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest , " the DOT said in a statement . AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a unit of AMR Corp. The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan Feb. 20 . American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the nation 's 17th largest passenger carrier . Their merger would not alter American 's third-place ranking , according to data compiled by Aviation Daily , a leading industry trade magazine . The combination would incrase American 's share of the U.S. market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct , the DOT said . The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers provide either nonstop or single-plane service . At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers , the DOT said it found no evidence that other carriers could not increase or begin service that competed with a merged American-AirCal . Concerning the 14th , " While entry may not be possible at the Orange County Airport in the near future , DOT found that the service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area , especially at the Los Angeles International Airport , will provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in long-haul markets , " the DOT said . The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County terminal , where environmental concerns and a small terminal building limit future opportunities for expansion . The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments opposing the merger but " raised no new facts or arguments .

liquified coal and other kinds of synthetic fuels , halted in recent years because of cheap and abundant petroleum supplies , will become economic again when world oil prices top 30 dlrs a barrel , an Exxon Co USA executive said . Joe McMillan , a senior vice president , told Reuters after addressing a Houston meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers , "By early in the next century , synthetics should play a significant role in this country 's energy supply . " McMillan also told reporters at a news conference that he believed synthetic fuels would become economic to develop when world oil prices reached a 30 to 40 dlr a barrel price range . "You 're talking about a 50 pct increase in crude oil prices , but I think that time is coming and we 've got to be prepared , " McMillan said . He predicted U.S. oil demand would rise by about one pct annually in the next few years while the nation fails to replace its oil reserves through exploration . By the turn of the century , world oil prices will be significantly higher because of declining supplies , McMillan said . Ashland Oil , Inc. chairman John Hall , who also spoke at the meeting , advocated some form of federal tax incentives to help spur development of synthetic fuels . The United States , Hall said , has nearly 500 billion tons of demonstrated coal reserves , an amount more than triple that of all the world 's known oil reserves . " We must encourage research now in order to make synfuels competitive later , " Hall said . The average lead time for development of a shale oil or liquified coal project is between five and ten years . Until last year , the federal government had subsidized synfuels development through the U.S. Synthetic Fuels Corp. , a research program created during the Carter Administration with the goal of developing replacements for up to two mln barrels of oil . The corporation was shut down last April when Congress refused to continue funding its eight billion dlr budget because of uneconomic projects based on forecasts of 50 dlrs a barrel oil and 10 dlr per mcf natural gas during this decade .

Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the full value of the company . In a letter to shareholders , Chairman A.

Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers . He said the board has authorized management to explore alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a " financially superior " alternative to the general acquisition offer . A Gencorp spokesman , in response to questions , would not comment on market speculation that the company 's management may develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own . He would also not comment on when a better alternative might be developed . Gencorp 's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer price since the tender was made .

Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years , Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder value , and the stock price and earnings have improved since he joined the company . Gencorp said the partnership 's offer is a " bargain price " acquisition that was " using financing from a syndicate of banks that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide .

its Mideast policy in light of its rising dependence on imported oil , according to Charles Ebinger of the Center for Strategic and International Studies . " The prospect of rising dependence on oil imports from the Gulf , and the recent revelations of the Tower Commission report , mandate more than ever before the need for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. interests in the Middle East , " Ebinger said . He remarks were made in an address to the National Petroleum Refiners Association meeting . " Although in the short run it is difficult to see a direct link between Arab anger and threats to oil supplies , in the current environment it will be increasingly difficult for moderate Arab leaders to be seen as friendly to U.S. interests , " Ebinger said . Oil traders said threats to oil supplies has kept crude oil prices strong recently although some believe prices will be weaker if demand falls in the spring . But William Randol , analyst at First Boston Corp , said crude oil prices will hold near current levels this spring . There will be no spring downturn , said Randol , speaking at the annual refiner meeting . He said there is a 40 pct chance that crude oil prices could move higher in the second half of the year , following an OPEC meeting scheduled for late June . He said he expects OPEC will extend its current agreement to restrict production . OPEC will renew its production pricing agreement in June because the value of the oil exports of the OPEC producers has declined along with the U.S. dollar , Randol said . OPEC oil exports are priced in U.S. dollars , and the dollar has fallen about 30 pct in the last 18 months . Randol said U.S. crude oil imports will increase 3.5 to four mln barrels per day by 1990 as consumption rises 1.5 to two mln bpd , and supplies decline two mln bpd . Reuter

The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a " superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill . " Poison pills are shareholder rights plan that make takeovers more expensive . Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its rights will trade separately from the common stock was extended to April six from April three . It said the extension was subject to further extensions by the board and is conditioned on no person aquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of Gencorp prior to April six . General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be completed in a timely manner using its financial arrangements . The partnership in its statement again urged management to work with it to facilitate a transaction . Reuter

signed an agreement on the establishment of an EC office here . Chinese vice-foreign minister Zhou Nan and the EC 's external relations commissioner , Willy De Clercq , signed the accord . EC sources said the office was likely to open in the second half of this year . In 1986 the EC was China 's third largest trading partner , with Chinese imports from the EC worth 5.7 billion dlrs and exports worth 2.6 billion dlrs . De Clercq told the official China Daily that more joint ventures should be set up in China as a way of reducing China 's trade deficit with the EC . The EC 's affairs in China are currently looked after by whichever country holds the group 's six-monthly rotating presidency , now held by the Belgians until the Danes take over in July . REUTER

been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen 's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States , political analysts said . Nakasone , already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan , may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) , they said . " The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone 's power base , " Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told Reuters . " So the emergence of U.S. Criticism damages Nakasone . " Even before the latest trade friction flared , Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax . "Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone , " Uchida said . "His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established toda y . " Nakasone , who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members , is now seeing his public support eroded , the analysts said . The yen 's rise to record highs and the U.S. Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan 's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone 's critics fresh ammunition , the analysts said . " Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone has n't worked effectively , " Rei Shiratori , director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan , said . This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone 's credibility , Shiratori told Reuters . The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue , the yen 's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections , analysts said . " If the elections go against the LDP , Nakasone may have to resign early , " Shiratori said . But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe U.S. Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29 , some analysts said . However , " unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues , he will face a very hostile audience , " said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling . " If the trip is a major disaster , it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin , " he said . Reagan 's own weakened domestic position , and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan , argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute , the analysts said . But a desire on both sides to find some solution , coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone , could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone , they said . "One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave , " Sterling said . REUTER

unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its <Del hi Australia Fund > ( DAF ) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs . The sale is effective from tomorrow , they said in a joint statement . The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed , CSR said in the statement . Delhi Australia Fund owns <Del hi Petroleum Pty Ltd> , which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects . In addition to the purchase price , CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi 's interests in the next two years , the statement said . " The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float , " CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement . Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale , CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier , he said . As reported separately , soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold , valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs . After Bass Strait , the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is Australia 's largest oil and gas producing area with current gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day ( BDP ) , gas liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic feet a day , the CSR-Esso statement said . The purchase gives Esso , a 50/50 partner with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait , its first onshore production in Australia , they said . Esso 's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the Cooper-Eromanga area . " These discoveries will help Australia 's self-sufficiency in oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass Strait production now under way , " McGill said . In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders , Kelman said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso . He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision in view of the risks associated with the oil business . The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years , he said . Kelman said a revaluation of CSR 's investment in Delhi to net realisable value as of today , CSR 's annual balance-date , will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs . However , revaluations and profits on sales of other assets will significantly reduce this loss , he said . He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents against 18 in 1985/86 .

electronic goods may upset West European officials , but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan . Japan 's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe , as it is in the United States . But U.S. Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold . The European Community ran a 18.2 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year , and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans , diplomats and economists said . But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the U.S. To do something about Japan 's huge trade surplus . " The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the U.S. , " said Martin Wolf , director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London . " Basically , their policies are pretty much the same . " But that did not mean Europe would support the U.S. , Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the U.S. Dispute to press its own claims , Wolf said .Basically , Europeans have a different approach to trade problems , he said . " In the U.S. , People talk about fair trade , but not here , " he added . " In the U.S. , It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition , while in Europe , the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich . " Wolf said this basic U.S. Attitude explains Washington 's tendency to impose so-called " countervailing duties " an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair . In Western Europe , the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation , Wolf said . In the latest U.S.-Japan trade row , President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs , alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 U.S.-Japan pact on microchip trade . But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers . " It follows that they 're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement , " said Wolf . Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues , government officials in the rest of Europe told Reuter correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the U.S.-Japan trade row . A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told Reuters there has been no change in the Community 's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances . In a statement issued after that meeting , EC foreign ministers deplored Japan 's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets . EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC . Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan . The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war , they said . Instead , the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan , including wines and spirits , cosmetics , and financial services , and will continue talking to try to improve the situation , the diplomats said . In Britain , where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market , officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered . But government officials said last night , " We are not talking about days or weeks . This is going to take time . " They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday , but added that no final decisions were expected . The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London 's booming financial markets , government officials said . REUTER

making it extremely difficult for Japan 's monetary authorities to prevent the yen 's rise against the dollar , but they have several options other than normal intervention , Bank of Japan sources said . A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks , which have not been invoked since 1978 , are all being considered . " But the time may not be ripe , " he said . " In this era of financial liberalisation , it 's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan ," said another senior bank official . But the first official said " From a technical viewpoint , the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so . " A swap agreement , an exchange of currency between two nations , allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other 's currency in case of need . " If the Bank invokes such swaps , both parties would announce the decision jointly , " said the first official . The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar . But intervention is at least an option , they said . Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct , they said . Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation . One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the U.S. And other central banks , if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions . " But we do n't think they have become short of yen quite yet , " he said . The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks , according to the sources . Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week . The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary , but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end .

In-yong will visit U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker next week to discuss U.S. Requests for an appreciation of South Korea 's won against the dollar , finance ministry officials said . They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund 's ( IMF ) Interim Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of reducing Seoul 's trade surplus with Washington . The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set . The IMF committee meeting , scheduled for April 9 , is expected to review the resolution reached by the six top industrialised nations in Paris last month calling for newly industrialised countries , such as South Korea and Taiwan , to allow their currencies to rise . The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul 's efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5 billion dlrs . South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won , but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly . Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this month a sudden won revaluation could result in South Korea running a large trade deficit and being forced to renege on its international debt repa yments .

selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . " It sounds like a good deal , " Stuart McKibbin of <A.C. Goode and Co> told Reuters . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the <Del hi Australia Fund > and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia 's largest sugar refiner , made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> . " This will be a big shock to the market , which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi , " McKibbin said . A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright , CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years . Delhi is one of Australia 's largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin . Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs . Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker <Bain and Co Ltd> said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company . " The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans , " Goldston-Morris said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia 's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , analysts said . They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year , they said . Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment , made in 1981 , which has dragged down the company 's overall performance , analysts said . CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt , they said . " It was a bad investment for them . They financed it entirely with debt , the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them ," Owen Evans of Sydney broker <Meares and Philips Ltd> said . Esso not only picked up Delhi 's oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions . Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> . " Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin . They have n't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production , " Goldston-Morris said .

collapse of International Tin Council ( IT C ) price support operations in 1985 , are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving , a Reuter survey showed . They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords ' support operations and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts . Consumers and producers , mindful of ITC buffer stock losses , have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations . Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case , the survey showed . The International Cocoa Organization ( ICCO ) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager ( BSM ) could do under the new agreement . It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits , prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated , after consumer insistence , that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa . This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia , the world 's fourth largest producer , undermining the market . The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades . A new International Natural Rubber Agreement ( IN RA ) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva . Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations . Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases . Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling . Legal wrangles continue . Recent International Coffee Organization ( ICO ) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality , commodity analysts said . Consumers and a small group of producers argued that " objective criteria " should be used to define export quota shares , which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil , the world 's leading producer . Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct . The talks broke down and , although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today , delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote . International agreements exist for sugar and wheat . These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements , collect statistics and draw up market analyses . Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth , while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat . An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups , made up of governments with advice from industry , such as those for lead and zinc and rubber . The U.N. Common fund for commodities , with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs , has failed to become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it . U.S. Officials in Washington said the U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives , citing the lack of widespread support . U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case . U.S. Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound , market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests . " We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward , " official Administration policy states . The U.S. Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the International Coffee Agreement ( ICA ) and INRA but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts . The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries , the State Department said . U.S. Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working . U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement , U.S. Officials said . Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case . Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country , the world 's top producer of rubber , tin and palm oil , decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case . Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ( ATPC ) which produce 65 pct of world tin . The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from 70,000 . Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa , wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London , " Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality , if there was full participation by producers and consumers , and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously . " But Baron added , " No real sanctions are available for a country that does n't stick to its obligations ...The German approach is sceptical . We do n't think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries . They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them . " Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements , reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries . But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for " intellectual honesty " and " objective criteria " have grown . British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid . It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact , they said . U.K. Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be . A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts , adding high prices inflate supply . A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts . France , a large consumer and producer of sugar , favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation , particularly regarding stocks . Indonesia 's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta " These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical ..But it 's another matter when there are structural problems ..But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith . " Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements . " The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work ," Martinez Cuenca said . The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry , Sebastiao do Rego Barros , told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality . If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas , with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices , it can work . UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries ' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations ' capital goods .

will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off U.S. Trade sanctions , company spokesmen said . The moves might persuade the U.S. To call off the sanctions , despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans , analysts said . The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan 's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact . In announcing the sanctions last Friday , President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan 's market to foreign products . But U.S. Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on U.S. Television that the U.S. Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a " clear indication " that it will open its markets to U.S. Goods . The Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter , following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter . MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports . Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month 's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan . " The U.S. Wants to be satisfied . It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business ," said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo . But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output , boosting imports the key to U.S. Withdrawal of the sanctions is more difficult . " The U.S. Does not have the low-end consumer IC 's ( integrated circui ts ) that the Japanese need for consumer products . They 're well supplied here , " said Richard May , senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo . The U.S. Leads in production of medium and high-end IC 's , but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills , the analysts said . " The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas , " said Edwards . A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HIT.T> , said the firm 's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory ( 256K DRAM ) was unrelated to MITI 's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions . Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM 's , he said . Company officials unveiled the following plans NEC Corp <NESI.T> , Japan 's largest chipmaker , plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 29.41 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 8.5 mln last quarter . In the year beginning April 1 , NEC will boost chip imports , which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before . Hitachi Ltd 's <HIT.T> April output of 256K DRAM 's will fall by 25.93 pct to four mln compared to 5.4 mln in March . The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target . Imports are currently very low . Toshiba Corp < TSBA.T> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 16.67 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports , a company official said . Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc ( MOT.N ) to sell the U.S. Firm 's chips in Japan . The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai , northern Japan . Mitsubishi Electric Corp ( MIET.T ) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 5.5 mln to 5.6 mln chips compared to the first quarter . Plans call for increased imports but an official said " boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand . " Fujitsu Ltd ( ITSU.T ) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels . Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd ( O KIE.T ) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March 's 3.2 mln . Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year 's total of more than five billion yen , a company official said . REUTER

its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business , share analysts said . CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs . In a twin announcement CSR , already Australia 's largest sugar refiner , made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs , but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products , analysts said . The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia 's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country , they said . Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid , through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices . REUTER

effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits , money dealers said . As a result , call money soared in active trading to around the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds . Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month . Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7 billion , actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion . To meet the daily average , dealers said , banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and tomorrow . But liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the Bundesbank 's offer for sale of Treasury bills on Friday . This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market . Though some liquidity , from bills bought on Thursday , flowed back into the market today , the bulk would not return until tomorrow , the start of the new month , dealers said . Dealers said the large banks , which they did not name , commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so . With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month , the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills , draining liquidity for three days . When other banks sought funds , rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return . One senior dealer said the Bundesbank , with advanced knowledge of the market 's needs , should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on Friday . Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day , the Bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day , he said . " ( Bundesbank dealers ) could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we 're not selling them in this amount , " he said . " If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses . Tomorrow it will be different . Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so . " But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates , given the delicate state of currency markets . International central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies , including the mark . Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone , contributing to downward pressure on the dollar . " The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct . In that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular , " the senior dealer said . Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or four pct . This is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism . Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between Germany 's major employers and the unions , the Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday , they said . Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business . REUTER

unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR has agreed to sell its <Del hi Australia Fund > ( DAF ) to Esso for 985 mln Australian dlrs . The sale is effective from tomorrow , they said in a joint statement . The previously announced float of part of its Delhi interest will not now proceed , CSR said in the statement . Delhi Australia Fund owns <Del hi Petroleum Pty Ltd> , which holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects . In addition to the purchase price , CSR will share equally in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi 's interests in the next two years , the statement said . " The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the float , " CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement . Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building materials in which CSR has had long and successful management experience and strong market leadership. With the sale , CSR will be able to expand those businesses more aggressively and earlier , he said . As reported separately , soon after announcing the Delhi sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold , valuing its entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs .

The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today 's closing market level of 1.85 dlrs a share . CSR said it will announce further details of the offer soon , including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer Sugar stock . It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer 's net earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over yesterday 's market price which CSR said it believed already contained an element of takeover speculation . It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer 's last reported net tangible assets per share , CSR said . CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings which will flow from integrated management of CSR 's and Pioneer 's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses . These economies can only be achieved through CSR control and management of Pioneer Sugar , it added . The takeover announcement came soon after CSR 's earlier reported statement that it will sell its <Del hi Petroleum Pty Ltd> unit to an Exxon Corp <XON> unit for 985 mln dlrs and not proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi .

The General Acquisition partnership called the response inflammatory and unproductive , particularly since it had tried to discuss the offer with Gencorp . The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would provide a " superior value yet they continue their attempt to prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison pill .

project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49 pct of its French unit <European Sugar ( France ) > and could raise around 400 mln dlrs , Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said . Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was aimed at " international markets " and that the figure of 400 mln dlrs given in some press reports " was probably about right . " European Sugar , wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA <ERDI.M> , is expected to absorb the European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc <CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy . Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs . A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit , but gave no details . The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the CPC business . In London yesterday , chairman of Belgian starch producer <Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi was " apparently still organising finance , " his company might still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business . Gardini , commenting on Callebaut 's remarks , said the 630 mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid " at the date foreseen in the preliminary contract . " Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in European Sugar , but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi 's purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by September 30 .

NV <AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities this year by making small acquisitions in the US. Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its 1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm American Enka in December 1985 , when US investments represented 20 pct of Akzo 's total capital . The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for losses in guilder income through the lower dollar , Loudon said . He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in the US , adding " It 's the largest industrial market in the world . " But he said the company would also be looking at possible acquisitions in Europe . Despite its highly liquid cash flow , Akzo did not plan acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the company 's debt/equity ratio , Loudon said . The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1 billion guilders on acquisitions , of which nearly two thirds were in the United States .

KCBT , has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal to raise the Chicago Board of Trade 's , CBT , speculative position limits on wheat futures contracts , saying the plan would put the the Kansas exchange " at a serious competitive disadvantage . " The Commodity Futures Trading Commission , CFTC , last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts , and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts . At the same time , CFTC proposed leaving KCBT 's wheat speculative position limits unchanged . " Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT 's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest , " Michael Braude , president of the Kansas exchange , said in a letter to CFTC . A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT 's limits . KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency , constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange 's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators . The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat .

definitive agreement to acquire Commercial Security Bancorp <CSEC> by exchanging Keycorp common valued at 63 dlrs for each Commercial Securities share . Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value of 102 mln dlrs . Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition . Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged , the agreement provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period , the agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be negotiated . Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to Commercial Security shareholders . The company said it will treat the merger as a pooling of interests . It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial Security shareholders and various regulators . Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as soon as possible after December 31 , 1987 , the date Utah 's interstate banking law becomes operational . Keycorp said Richard K.

that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace all oil and gas produced . The company said that it added about four pct to production bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd , the highest level since 1979 , based largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not replace all of the oil and gas produced . The company said that the average price for oil and gas declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38 pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production . Exxon 's earnings from exploration and production in 1986 fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985 . Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from the Gulf of Mexico , Alaska , the North Sea , Malaysia and from oil sands in Canada . Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe and the Far East . But capital expenditures for exploration and production were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year and further reductions were expected in 1987 . Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached a new high of 422,000 bpd . The light , sweet crudes produced from these North Sea fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper , lower quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded over the past several years . The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to earnings gains from refining and marketing . Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986 , up from 872 mln dlrs in 1985 . The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043 mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year . Exxon 's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500 mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown , Texas refinery completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes to extract higher proportions of light products .

Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) is seen as a test case by the Soviet Union , which will probably demand to follow China , a top European Community official said . Willy de Clercq , External Relations Commissioner of the European Communities , told a news conference that China 's application would involve long and difficult negotiations . China formally applied to join GATT in July 1986 and in February presented a memorandum backing its application , which De Clercq said was now being studied . Questions would then be presented to China . " After China , other important state-trading countries including the Soviet Union , will probably demand accession . China 's application could be considered a test case , " he said . He said the EC strongly backed China 's application , but others among GATT 's 92 contracting parties took a tougher line . Among the numerous problems of a huge centrally-run economy entering a free trade system are tariffs and reciprocity and the expectation that China will practice an open-trade policy without trade discrimination , de Clercq added . De Clercq noted the different dimensions of the Chinese economy and those of Hungary and Yugoslavia , the two current Socialist GATT members . On China 's import potential , he said a foreign exchange shortage would force China to import less this year and next than in the past , with an emphasis on technological equipment and capital .

increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest crude oil prices in a decade . Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings , such as reductions in exploration expenses , were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985 . The company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead . The company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985 .

The company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year . Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct .

conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop , the U.S. embassy 's agricultural officer in Belgrade said . The officer , who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica , said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather . He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather . Damaging effects were seen in the fields , most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings , he said . The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development , his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say . The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils . Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable , he said . However , he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed , which would aid recovery . Reuter

Office of Management and Budget chief James Miller defended an administration plan to sell the U.S. Naval Petroleum Reserves . In response to hostile questioning from a member of the House Appropriations Committee , the officials said the plan was justified to help bring the fiscal 1988 budget deficit and to get the government out of the oil business . Miller acknowleged the estimated sale proceeds at 3.3 billion dlrs would actually bring down the deficit by about 2.2 billion dlrs because of the loss of revenues from the sale of oil from the reserves . Miller said the sale price may end up higher . " We 'd sell it to the highest bidder , " Miller said . " If we can get more we 'll take it . " Reuter

opened talks with President Ronald Reagan expected to focus on superpower arms control moves and trade issues . French officials said a major aim of Chirac 's visit was to present France 's concern that the United States might ignore European security interests in any accord with Moscow on removing medium-range nuclear missiles from the continent . But Reagan was expected to assure Chirac that he will not agree to a deal at the Geneva superpower talks that would give the Russians superiority in shorter-range systems , diplomats said . France has expressed doubts about removing U.S. missiles from Europe so long as the Soviet Union maintains an edge in other weapo nry , particularly shorter-range rockets , conventional forces and chemical weapons . Speaking last night , Chirac set out the French position saying " Any agreement on intermediate nuclear forces should mention how equality can be achieved in short-range missiles . " Reagan and Chirac meanwhile signed an agreement ending a dispute between two leading research institutes over patent rights to a blood screening test for the deadly disease AIDS . In a joint statement , Chirac and Reagan said the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the National Cancer Institute , of Bethesda , Maryland , agreed to give part of the royalties from the test to a new foundation dedicated to the wordwide fight against AIDS ( Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ) . " This agreement opens a new era in Franco-American cooperation , allowing France and the United States to join their efforts to control this terrible disease in the hopes of speeding the development of an AIDS vaccine and cure , " Reagan said at the signing ceremony . He said the two parties would share the patent and give 80 per cent of the royalties received to the new foundation . The foundation would also raise private funds and would donate 25 per cent of its money to combat AIDS in less developed countries . Both leaders stressed the long ties between France and the United States during a welcoming ceremony in the White House East Room , with Reagan describing France as " America 's oldest ally in war and peac e . " " I have come to tell you that we are remain motivated by the same ideals of freedom , by the same will to face the dangers which we both confront terrorism , war , hunger , poverty , new diseases and drugs , " Chirac replied . But the two countries are likely to have less to agree on over the issue of trade , where Chirac is worried about a rise in protectionism in the U.S. Congress . A senior U.S. official yesterday dismissed a French idea to sell cut-price grain to poor countries in Africa as a way of lessening surplus stocks . Chirac is expected to canvass support for the idea , first proposed by French Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume , during his two-day visit to Washington . The U.S. official described the idea as a " grain producers ' OPEC " a reference to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and said it went against the Reagan administration 's desire to lessen government intervention in trade .

chief executive of GenCorp Inc , told shareholders he expects to announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile tender within a week . Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the tender . Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient , saying the group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate GenCorp while " we have had only 10 days to respond . " Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV , serving the New York City market , and expects to complete the sale by Friday . Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV . The company plans to sell the station to MCA Inc <M CA> for 387 mln dlrs . Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were dropped or dismissed . The Federal Communications Commission has already approved the station 's sale . Money from the sale of the station will play a role in helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown , Reynolds said . He provided no other details . Randall Hubbard , chairman of AFG , and Joel Reed , chief financial officer of Wagner and Brown , attended the meeting , which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel . About 300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm . Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters . Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members have been telling him " B ill , just do n't pay greenmail " to end the takeover threat . Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority shareholder at a price not available to other holders . Reynolds said he considers it a " repugnant device . " Shareholders elected management 's slate of 11 directors . Mario Gabelli , head of a New York investment firm which owns a large block of stock , proposed one nominee for the board . Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to " stiffen the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail . " Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they are open to negotiations with GenCorp . Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the event of a shift in control of the company , Reynolds asserted " we 're developing alternatives that would not result in a change in control . " Asked whether the company 's plan would be superior to any proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown , Reynolds commented , " We know the company , we know the values and we know the opportunities better than any outside group .

United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin . But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip , or whether this week 's falling share prices mark the start of a " bear " market . " It 's the billion dollar question , " said Richard O'Brien , economist at American Express International Bank in London . Japan 's trade surplus 92.7 billion dlrs last year has poured into share and bond markets around the world , and funded a good chunk of the huge U.S. Budget deficit . Around a third of any new sale of U.S. Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese . However , Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit . The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the U.S. Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods , may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit . And if the U.S. Trade deficit does fall , the Japanese will have less money to invest . To entice U.S. Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying U.S. Bonds , interest rates would have to soar , O'Brien said . The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets . " A year ago , we could be pretty confident about the markets , " said O'Brien . " Now , it is much less certain . " Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy . But the world economy , with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations , a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape , said O'Brien . Nevertheless , New York analyst William Raferty , of Smith Barney Harris Upham said " We 're still in a bull market ," adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and " The bear usually strikes slowly . " Economist Evelyn Brody , at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London , said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices . Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it 's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in U.S. Dollars and especially the U.S. Treasury ( bond ) market , according to David Butcher , a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd 's bond operation in London . He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark . In the longer run , he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar 's slide will mean for securities markets . REUTER

resist GAF Corp 's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer , but the Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer , either from GAF or its own management , analysts believe . Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF through a restructuring . The speculation pushed Borg-Warner 's stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading . Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF. " It seems from at least their dealing with ( raider Irwin ) Jacobs that they do n't want to be taken over . The question is now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively , they want to remain independent , " said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps . Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation for almost a year . Last week , Jacobs ' investment vehicle , Minstar Inc , and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln Borg-Warner shares . The same day , GAF Corp raised its stake by 9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding . Jacobs was interested in buying the company , but took no steps toward a transaction . " Their ( Borg-Warner ) policy has been to stonewall them for the last nine months . It 's been one of the dullest corporate battles I 've seen , " said one analyst . The battle , however , has heated up , and the range of breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market price to almost 60 dlrs per share . Most analysts said they think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate . Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner . Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials company in some other way . Heyman two years ago attempted an unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp , but GAF benefited from that company 's restructuring . " Borg Warner ca n't quibble that it 's not a legitimate offer . It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of between a rock and a hard place . They either have to accept a 46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it 's sweetened . I personally think the company is ( worth ) around 55 dlrs per share , " said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson . Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James Goldsmith . The company bought back the financier 's stock and carried out a wider share repurchase . Arbitragers , however , said they do not believe Heyman is seeking " greenmail , " or the repurchase of his stock by the company at a premium . Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with financing the transaction . Previously associated with " junk bond " experts , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner takeover with bank financing . GAF said it would make a tender offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner board and conditioned on the board 's recommendation of the tender offer and merger . Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees since the two companies businesses overlap . Analysts , however , believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay debt from the transaction . GAF 's stock rose 1-5/8 today , to 48-5/8 . " I believe , obviously , if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values substantially , " said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose . He said at 46 dlrs per share , Heyman 's average cost for the company 's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF 's current holdings . Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business , which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman . Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg 's earnings . The plastics are used in telephone equipment , office equipment and appliances . " Borg has half the market in the U.S. and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator , " Rose said . Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co <DO W> and Monsanto Corp <MTC> , he said . Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business , and a protective systems business , which includes Wells Fargo security guards . It also has an information services business , and is trying to sell its financial services business . Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986 . Smaller GAF , in 1986 , earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs . GAF 's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer , a special union carbide dividend , and the sale of its Union Carbide shares .

USDA 's Foreign Agricultural Service Administrator Thomas Kay told Reuters DOT could owe USDA as much as 20 mln dlrs . The two departments are trying to hammer out an accord on how to fund the increasing share of food aid required to be shipped on U.S. flag vessels under a 1985 farm bill provision on cargo preference . Sims said the agencies were near to reaching a memorandum of understanding governing how DOT would pay for its share of the cargo preference costs . Under the 1985 bill , the percentage of food aid shipments carried on U.S. vessels was to increase gradually over three years to 75 pct in 1988 from 50 pct . Although the increased cost was to be funded by DOT , Sims said that department to date has contributed no money . Reuter

Under the new system , producers and refiners will be allowed to negotiate volumes of shut-in oil to be delivered under purchase contracts . Shut-in crude is the surplus between the total amount of oil being produced and the amount being purchased by refiners . " We have talked to a number of our major suppliers , and we 've discussed the upcoming change with them , but nothing has been finalized , " Imperial 's manager of western crude supply Gary Strong said .

" The market is taking a breather now , and I would expect it to last a little longer , " said Craig Slo ane , a currency analyst with Smith Barney , Harris , Upham and Co. Profit-taking , which robbed the currency futures of some momentum today , is likely to continue , he said . Central banks are likely to play a role in halting the advance in currencies through intervention , the analysts said , even though the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the Japanese yen on Monday despite Bank of Japan intervention . Treasury Secretary James Baker 's comments that the G-6 nations remain committed to the Paris accord , coupled with his refusal to give any targets for exchange rates , provided a note of stability to the market Tuesday , the analysts said . Furthermore , Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David Horner said G-6 central banks have n't yet shown the full force of their commitment to the Paris accord . " I 'm among those who believe the G-6 have a plan behind the scenes , " Horner said . Horner said more forceful central bank intervention will firm the dollar and cap the rise in currency futures . " Coordinated , punishing intervention " by the central banks in contrast to the recent rolling intervention which has only smoothed out the market is in the offing , according to Horner . " I think we 're near the top of the range in the Europeans ( currencies ) ," he said . On the other hand , the upside target for the yen , which set a new contract high today at 0.006916 in the June contract , is at 0.007050 , Horner said . Still , other analysts believe currency futures have yet to peak . " The basic trend in the currencies is higher , " said Anne Parker Mills , currency analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. " The market wants to take the dollar lower . " Uncertainty over central bank action and nervousness over a G-5 meeting next week in advance of a meeting of the International Monetary Fund could make for choppy price activity the remainder of the week , Mills said .

stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture , a grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said . The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are " the first report we 've had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody , " said John " Bu d " Frazier , grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour Mac Laine , Inc. " I 'm really excited about it , " Frazier said . The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn , down from 76.7 mln planted last year , and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans , down from 61.5 mln . The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans , 8.3 billion bushels of corn , and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat , all below trade guesses . Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann , senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis , and Mark Meyer , a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers , Inc. , on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports . Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market , and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel " if the bell rang right now . " " We 're getting our disappearance up . We have less ( co rn and soybeans ) than we thought we had , " he said , noting that hog and poultry production is up . " We 're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand , " said Meyer , adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter . However , Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption . She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states , where yields are usually low . " We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year , ( which ) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow 's opening , " she said . Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible , and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels , which would be down from last year 's 8.25 billion bushels . " We 'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks ," she said . The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels . Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term , " But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices . " Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans . The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill . " There seems to be no desire to change the farm law we 're working under today , and this report should reinforce that , " Frazier said . " We are seeing the program beginning to work ," said Meyer . Reuter

7-3/4 pct by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank today will be followed by other banks only after they see clearer signs of the Federal Reserve 's policy intentions , economists said . " Based on the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate , it probably makes sense for others to follow , but no rush is likely , " said Paul McCulley of E.F. Hutton and Co. Citibank 's surprise base rate increase , quickly followed by Chase , sent U.S. bond prices lower and the dollar higher . McCulley said that once the spread between three-month certificates of deposit and the prime rate narrows to less than 1-1/2 percentage points , there is a strong chance of a prime rate increase . It has been under 1-1/4 points recently . However , banks are likely to hold rate increases until they see what the Fed intends to do about interest rates in the near term , analysts said . They noted that banks historically like to follow Fed rate movements , rather than lead them . For example , the last prime rate increase occurred in June 1984 when banks lifted the rate to 13 pct from 12-1/2 pct after a Fed discount rate increase in April of that year . Major banks had been posting a 7-1/2 pct prime rate since last August 26/27 , when they lowered the rate from eight pct shortly after the Fed 's half-point discount rate cut to the current 5-1/2 pct level on August 20 . " The banks will not rush to raise their prime rates . There should be a split prime for a while with some posting a 7-1/2 pct rate and others 7-3/4 pct , " said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. Jones said the Federal Open Market Committee at today 's meeting voted no change in Fed policy . But he said the Fed may well foster higher interest rates soon . Jones said that , while the FOMC probably voted no policy change today , it may have decided to apply slight upward rate pressure later if the dollar weakens , inflation pressures heat up or the economy shows sign of strong recovery . " The Fed clearly indicated that they did not intend to tighten policy when they did today 's coupon pass , " said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co. In a move that came a day earlier than most expected , the Fed today supplied permanent reserves to the banking system by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury notes and bonds for its own account . This seasonal reserve add is called a " pass . " " The Fed demonstrated that there has been no policy change , " said Elizabeth Reiners , economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. She said the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate is now around 137 basis points compared with a 153 basis point average in 1986 . Reiners said the spread is not really narrow enough to present a clear need for a prime rate increase . The Dean Witter economist said that today 's prime rate rise " may have been less a response to interest rates than an attempt to enhance the ( balance sheet ) bottom line . " Reiners said that , given recent problems with loans to developing countries , large money center banks with heavy exposures might be the first to match the higher prime rate in an effort to get more profitable spreads on other loans . The Federal funds rate at which banks lend overnight money to one another could help determine how many banks match the higher prime rate and also how quickly they move . In raising their prime rates , banks cited a higher cost of funds . In the three business days through Monday , the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another averaged nearly 6-1/4 pct . But quarter end pressures helped push up funds . The Fed funds rate was extremely volatile today , reflecting demand pressure associated with the end of the quarter and the close of the Japanese fiscal year . Funds traded between five and 6-3/4 pct . Once the special distortions end , analysts said the funds rate probably will return to its recent trading level in the 6-1/8 pct area . They said that , if it stabilizes near there , banks may not quickly boost their prime rates . But a consistently higher funds rates would suggest to many that the Fed was fostering somewhat higher interest rates to help the dollar . Then banks would lift prime rates quickly . Reuter

over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices , the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says . Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy . But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller , who joined the board last August . He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed , but argues that such an arrangement , particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries , could reduce the volatility of exchange rates . Moreover , it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves , slowing changes in inflation . His idea , which many conservative economists find appealing , has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan . It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation , key indicators such as unemployment , and the rise or fall of the money supply . Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly . Discussed on and off for a long time , the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base . " What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes , " says Heller . In the past , this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies . A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa . The so-called fixed rate system , scuttled in the early 1970s , is still considered unworkable in the present world . But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely , adding vast pressures to the monetary system , is also being widely questioned . Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also . For one thing , there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy . Moreover , some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement . The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that , not surprisingly , helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems . Treasury Secretary James Baker , the Reagan administration 's chief economic architect , has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes , Seven , as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters . He appears convinced that officials from West Germany , France , Britain , Japan , Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing . The Heller approach , while extremely complex , could have a profound impact on the system , ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates . As envisioned by Heller , a basket of say , 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil , would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis . " In times of rising commodity prices , monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices , montary policy might be eased , " he says . He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets , and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis . Moreover , most commodity prices are produced , consumed and traded on a world-wide basis , so "that an index has a relevance for the entire world , " he says . In addition , commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes . " Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures , the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions , " he says . However , he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel , would have to be discounted in such a system . He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities . Reuter

The company said conditions of the offer include the receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator 's shares outstanding , on a fully diluted basis , and the repeal of its share purchase rights plan . Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the previously announced sale of Purolator 's Canadian operations . Emery said Chemical Bank , Bankers Trust , Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for the tender offer . It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate , payable twice a year . For the first three years after the notes are issued , interest will be paid , at Emery 's option , in cash or in additional notes , Emery said . It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption for one year after they are issued . Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit of the company after the merger . It said it hoped Purolator 's management would continue with the company . " We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit with each other and that the combination will enable each of us to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges of the future , " Emery 's chairman said in his letter . He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial turnaround that Purolator 's management had previously forecast . Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for comment on the offer , which was released several hours after the stock market had closed . Emery 's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8 .

farmland as we have done since 1980 , there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on . " Xu Jinfeng , a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai , sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes . China has to feed one quarter of the world 's population , but only one seventh of its land is arable . Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985 , and again in 1986 . But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time , has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them . Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year . It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years . " We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began , " official Xu said . " Since then , nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up . " " L ast year we lost land to a new railway line , " Xu said . But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses , she added . The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership , which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year . " The present situation of abusing , occupying unlaw fully , wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious , " said an article in the official press explaining the new measures . " It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland , " it said . " China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient . " An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses , while anything more than that must be approved by the city government . The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure China 's people get enough grain to eat . The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low , making it more profitable for them to grow other crops . To offset this , the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy . The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to China 's 200 mln city residents . Rural factories also subsidise grain output , paying farmers bonuses to grow it . Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices . Chen Z u yuan , Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang , said the government listened too much to the demands of " selfish city people " and could raise city grain prices without any problem . But the government has ruled out a price rise . " Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability , " said a China Daily editorial this month . The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term . " We must be very careful . We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises , " he said . " The problem is how to do it . " The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents . In addition , the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular . The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves , memorial halls for ancestors and homes . Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s , farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops , but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land . "As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark , farmers are beginning to worry about the future , " the China Daily said in an editorial last month . Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it . For most of the period of Communist rule , the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative . " New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment , " the newspaper said . REUTER

grain-producing province is not increasing , because farmers lack incentives , production costs are rising , storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain , the province 's vice-governor said . The China Daily quoted Yang Jike , vice-governor of Anhui , as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain , and three times as much growing cash crops like flax . He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers ' earnings , from 20 pct in 1982 , and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall . Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province 's total investment , from 26 pct in 1978 . He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year , and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats . He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles , rather than the essentials . He called for more investment in grain production , an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports . The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan , a delegate to the National People 's Congress , attacking grain policy . He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct . " With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years , some people got carried away , relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production , " he said . On Saturday , vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain . Now it exports corn from the northeast , but it imports wheat . " Grain consumption is rising every year . Even if we reach the 1987 target of ( 405 mln tonnes ) , it cannot be considered adequate , " Tian said . REUTER

steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower , Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said . But he told the bank 's annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates , rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements . " Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates , " he said . " The money market rates are the important ones . " Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations . An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth . A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation , braking the expansion of money supply . " T hus , you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time ," he added . Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy , since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark . Growth this year should be at least one pct , he said , describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start , unrepresentative of the rest of the year . After an economic contraction in the first quarter , the economy should show an uptrend in the last three . " We do n't believe that the economy has tipped over , but see it more as a 'growth dip , ' " Seipp said . But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy , saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct . The current peak rate is 56 pct . The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth . Seipp added the federal government should make " further courageous steps to decrease the state 's proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibilit y . " Reuter

expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986 because of keener competition from South Korea and China , the rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products , industry sources said . Last year , Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons ( l dt ) , up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985 , Lin Chung-j ung , a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association ( TSIA ) spokesman , told Reuters . China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt , he said . Yao Liu , president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co , a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung , told Reuters , " We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports . " Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the U.S. , Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel . Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986 , a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said . Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan 's steel exports are more expensive than South Korea 's and China 's . The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by the end of the year from 34.23 today , Yao said . In comparison , the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period , he added . " We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases , " he said . Taiwan 's steel exports to the U.S. , Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier , the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said .

prime rates by half a percentage point to 6-1/2 pct following a one-quarter point prime rate increase by two major U.S. Banks yesterday , dealers said .

Commerzbank AG 's management board chairman Walter Seipp called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities repurchase agreements down . But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit policies at the moment . There was little domestic and foreign pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change . Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits , dealers said . Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7 billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the first 30 days of March , the exact requirement needed just one day before the end of the month . Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks .

follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit markets today , economists said . Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4 pct . Chase Manhattan quickly followed . Prices quickly fell by a full point , even though the dollar the market 's overriding concern of late rose sharply on the news . Citibank cited the higher cost of money , especially in the Euromarket , as the reason for raising its prime rate . Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar , but economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed , whose policy-making federal open market committee , FOMC , meets this week , is already tightening its grip on credit . " The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the banking system 's reserve needs this statement period , but I would n't conclude anything until I 've seen the Fed data , " said Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank .

O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction blocking the planned merger of Delta <DAL> Airlines Inc and Western Airlines < WAL> , the Court said . O'Connor 's action came hours after a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation had been settled by arbitration . A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of the injuction , allowing the merger , worth nearly 860 mln dlrs , to go through as planned later today . The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details . Each of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to provisionally overturn its rulings without comment . The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of Atlanta-based Delta , which had been preparing for the merger for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes belonging to Western , which has headquartera in Los Angeles . "Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight , " Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late last night . " There was really very little that remained to be done . " The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport Employees union sought to force Western 's management to fulfill a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took place . The airlines argued that Western 's promise could not be enforced in a takeover by a larger company . After learning of the appeals court ruling , Delta officials last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees should report for work today in their old uni forms , not in new Delta outfits . Delta announced last September that it was purchasing Western . The merger took place in December , and Western has been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then . The Western name was to have disappeared at midnight last night . At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to represent Western employees after the integration of the two airlines . While all but eight pct of Western 's 11,000 employees are unionized , only Delta 's pilots are union members . Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts with Western The Association of Flight Attendants and the Teamsters , as well as the Air Transport Employees would be " extinguished " after today .

offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow . Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary , semi-annual grain talks in February . Moscow 's decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects . Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13 . Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow , was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer . Administration officials in and out of the U.S. Agriculture Department have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer . But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant , suggesting that an offer , while not a " done deal , " is a live possibility . Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives many of whom asked not to be identified continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent . Others , who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible , are saying they would not rule one out . Rep. Pat Roberts , R-Kan. , yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks . Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials . Richard Fritz , director of international marketing at U.S. Wheat Associates , said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month . Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat . Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans . As ever , one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price . Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices far above world market prices . The administration 's decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism , grain trade sources said . Nonetheless , the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were " chortling " because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U.S. housewives . The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer , combined with continued hard times in the U.S. grain belt , would favor a subsidy offer . In addition , the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively . However , observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration 's announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer . Up until the time of the announc ment , congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets , but also a much broader list of countries . Instead , the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets . That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union .

monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community , an EC official said . The official , who asked not to be named , told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement . Under the accord , which began in January , third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market , as well as 300,000 tonnes of sorghum . However , the official said the U.S. Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders . The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board . EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable terms than that from the U.S. No Commission spokesman was immediately available for comment .

rates have grown in recent days but bank chiefs are divided over the issue . Karl Vak , General Director of the Zentralsparkasse und Kommerzialbank , Wien , called today for a cut of up to half a percentage point in interest rates across the board . But Hannes Androsch , head of Creditanstalt-Bankverein <CABV.VI> told Reuters he opposed a cut because it would hurt small savers . Vak told a news conference that last January 's cut in lending rates for commercial customers and for all depositors by a quarter point had been insufficient . The January cut followed the National Bank 's lowering of its discount and Lombard rates by half a point in line with a similar Bundesbank move . Prime lending rate is now 8.75 pct and deposit rates vary between 3.25 and 5.75 pct . Yesterday Hellmuth Klauhs , head of the Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG , said rates could fall at least a quarter of a point , or even half a point if German rates dropped further . Vak noted that inflation had fallen below one pct . A widening gap between Austrian rates and cheaper West German credit along with forecasts of slow Austrian economic growth this year also justified a further interest drop , he said . Karl Pale , head of Girozentrale und Bank der oesterreichischen Sparkassen AG [ GIRV.VI ] has also called for lower deposit rates but said lending rates should remain unchanged at the moment . Interest margins were too small , particularly when compared with other West European countries . But Hans Haumer , head of the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse-Bank told Reuters that no cut should be made unless West German rates came down first . Banking sources said no bank seemed ready to lower rates alone and supporters of a cut would have difficulty overcoming opposition from Creditanstalt , Austria 's biggest bank . REUTER

massive central bank purchases , is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment , dealers and analysts said . Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend , but , without accompanying policy changes , they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day , the sources said . " Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention , " said Jim O'Neill , a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar , instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention . After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct , the first change in the rate since last August , the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen , up two yen from Tuesday 's New York low . By contrast , monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen . Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar . The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray , but is no longer mesmerized . " They 've lost their credibility . The market feels it can take on the central banks and win , " said Michael Snow , head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York . The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22 , 1985 , Plaza accord . Then , however , central banks had an easy time of it , because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances . Now , there is no such consensus . The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement , while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries . For its part , the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability , dealers say . Specifically , they said the Fed 's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted , designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets . " It 's been pro-forma intervention , " said Francoise Soares-Kemp , chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais . Because of this discord and the market 's momentum for a lower dollar , analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail . " It 's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar ( at these levels ) ," said Snow , who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation . " There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars , " added " B u ying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it . " Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter , when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack , central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks , analysts said . Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely . " I do n't think anybody has the stomach for it , because they saw the futility of it in the seventies . " Indeed , because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then , intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market . Trading volume in London , New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day , according to a joint central bank study , about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group . There are signs that central banks , too , realize the futility of swimming against the tide . Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar , such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks , are being considered . " In this era of financial liberalization , it 's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan ," one senior official in Tokyo said . Reuter

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV offer , which it said it considers inadequate . The alternatives being explored include a restructuring , leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another company , Conrac said . Conrac , which said its board discussed the alternatives at special meetings on March 26 and 30 , said that its decision on whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on " the future actions of Mark IV " and its unsolicitied tender offer .

Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it becomes final , the company said . The board also took other defensive steps , including granting severance agreements to some officers , it said . At a board meeting yesterday , Conc ac 's directors deleted a provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to remove directors without cause , the company said . The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority of the company 's common stock in the offer , Conrac said .

damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday , particularly in Buenos Aires province , trade sources said . They said the sunflower , maize , soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected . New production forecasts were made for all these crops . The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province . The weather bureau said the rains , which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days , could continue . The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains . In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts , notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay . In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places , in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm . The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa . Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth , the sources said . The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops , further dimishing the yield , the sources added . Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe , Cordoba , La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces . The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes , against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week , making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season . The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares , down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86 . The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba , Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires . It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days , weather permitting . Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes , against last week 's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes , down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production . The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season 's production . The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers ' targets , against 14 to 16 pct the previous week . The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes , against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week , 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season 's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes . The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares , down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86 . The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week . It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes , against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes . These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season 's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes , according to private sources , and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes . The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop , sources said . Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further . The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season . Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires . Reuter

leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40 mln dlrs , but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer may surface . Purolator 's stock climbed 5-3/8 today , to 40-1/8 , 1/4 over Emery 's 40 dlr per share offer . Emery topped a 35 dlr per share or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc. Some analysts said the latest , 306 mln dlr offer for Purolator exceeded their expectations . Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share range . At least one , however , estimated the company could be taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share . Analysts today would not venture to say whether another offer could be made , but some arbitragers still held to the belief that the bidding could go higher . " They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer . Emery has shown the courage to go forth , " said one arbitrager , who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as bidders . " It makes sense , " said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey . But " It wo n't make out as well as they think . They wo n't get a 100 pct of the synergies . " Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in the short term , but long term , after eliminating redundancies and selling other Purolator assets , it should boost Emery 's profitability . Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package delivery company after Federal Express Corp <FDX> , which has 47 pct of the market . Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery business . " This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight ( delivery ) business , but it will not make them a power house , " said Douglas Arthur of Kidder , Peabody and Co. Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer , and its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call . E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer , but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST. One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely Hutton will attempt another offer . However , he was skeptical a company outside the package delivery industry would want to outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same synergies as a courier company . Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group <EF H> subsidiary , speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come . The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator board member , Doresy Gardner resigned in March . Gardner said he believed a better offer could be made by another entity . A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had no contact with Emery , nor did he have any other buyers lined up for Purolator . Purolator 's deal with Hutton was also called into question by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week , which attempted to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth . Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday . Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to keep its cash tied up in Purolator . Hutton is providing a 279 mln dlr " bridge " loan that would later be replaced with other debt . Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator . Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its 279 mln dlr loan . Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln dlrs . Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in revenues . Reuter

A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the Canadian Parliament 's finance committee on March 20 for a substantial cut in credit card rates " was a factor " in the move , but he would not elaborate . Canada 's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had threatened legislation to reduce the rates , which apply to unpaid balances , if the financial institutions did not voluntarily act .

Edelman has acquired a stake in Polaroid Corp and optimism about tomorrow 's status hearing on the patent infringement suit pending with Eastman Kodak Co <EK> sent Polaroid 's stock higher , traders said . Polaroid rose 1-1/8 to 74-1/2 . " Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago , and resurfaced today , " one trader said . Edelman had no comment on the rumors . A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the company . " There is some hope among investors that there will some progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent infringement suit with Kodak , " analyst Michael Ellmann of Wertheim and Co said . Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement . The suit , filed by Polaroid in April 1976 , charges that Kodak infringed upon Polaroid 's instant camera patent . In October 1985 , the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or film that infringe upon the patent , the Polaroid spokesman said . Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any progress will be made in tomorrow 's hearing .

interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S. wheat , an executive with a major grain export company said . Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive , said George Hoffman , director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company . " Pillsbury is assuming that they ( Soviets ) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to , " Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here . But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer , the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes , he said . Hoffman said Pillsbury 's internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer . However , if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels , Moscow would likely buy more , he said . " If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese , I expect they 'll take it , " said Vernon McMinimy , director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer .

The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn exports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa and the Middle East , areas which have traditionally purchased their corn needs from the United States , the department said . Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports are for the year up to September 30 1987 . They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes have been issued so far . Reuter

Tuesday 's quarter-point prime rate cuts by Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank , the first prime rate boosts since mid-198 4 . Most cited narrower spreads between the prime and funding costs as justi fication . Analysts said the prime rate rises may have been triggered partly by a desire by banks to enhance profit margins given problems with developing country loans . Commenting on the prime rate increases , U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told a House Appropriations Committee that " I hope it was a temporary blip upward . " Among the major banks which today announced prime rate increases to 7-3/4 pct were Bankers Trust , Chemical Bank , Continental Illinois National Bank , Harris Trust and Savings Bank , Irving Trust , Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co , Marine Midland , and Security Pacific National Bank .

week , U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term , financial analysts said . However , some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold , and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline . Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar , they said . "As the dollar goes , so goes the bond market ," said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs . The recent decline in the dollar , which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday , was reversed Wednesday when several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point , to 7-3/4 pct . " Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar , foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over , " Gibbs said . The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation . Indeed , the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserve 's policy making arm , the Federal Open Market Committee , this week , analysts said . " To the Fed , the combination of a falling dollar , a steepening yield curve , and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation , " said Denis Karnosky , analyst at Carroll , McEntee and McGinley Inc. Such expectations could mean that " a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration , " at the FOMC meeting , he said . Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening , Karnosky said . Rather , the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window , he said . Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months , he said . In the meantime , however , " the market looks a bit oversold , " said Jim Wysoglad , analyst at Golden Gate Futures . Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32 . Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32 . " All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level , " Keefe said . If that level is broken , and the dollar continues to decline , Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93 , the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984 .

approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program , EEP , through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union . The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year . In addition to the amendments on EEP , the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb , casein , sugar-containing products and tobacco . Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee , which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation , will oppose them , Congressional sources said . The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988 . The amendments , offered by Rep. Dan Glickman , D-Kan. , also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now . Furthermore , the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value , not acquisition value . Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate . The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union , offered by Rep. Bob Smith , R-O re. , does not require the administration make an offer , but urges such action . The committee approved an amendment , offered by Rep. Glenn English , D-Okla. , requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production . Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment , saying such commodity agreements do not work . Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel , the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas . The amendment , offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland , R-Minn. , is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products . It also may affect pea nut , cotton and tobacco imports , Committee sources said . Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein , a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland . The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports . Other miscellaneous amendments included Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports . Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now .

Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in West Germany this year , with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive . Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in West Germany this year , but there was little room for further falls . Rates in the U.S. were however rising , as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves , but this rise would be moderate . Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months . One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking down the dollar , he noted . The recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks , he said . He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test . " A massive attack on the mark , which could come if we get bad news out of the U.S. , Would require a much higher intervention amount , raising the danger of inflation , " he said .

" He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm . " The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself , " Watanabe said . Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups , one of which included C and W , seeking to compete against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> , which now monopolizes Japan 's overseas telephone business . The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe 's efforts . A British source , who declined to be identified further , said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W <CAWL.L> and the other firms involved . C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm , compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed . C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge .

" It 's probably a sensible approach on their part , " the British source told reuters . C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the U.S. The proposed merger has sparked an international row , with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms .

sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements , the Australian Wheat Board ( AWB ) said . "Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious , demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications , " the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage , Handling and Transport . "Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia , " it said . The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system . Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades , the AWB submission said . It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping . Better industrial relations at grain terminals , more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing , it said . The submission also said Australia 's federal system impeded the AWB 's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat . The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment . " It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port , irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored , " it said . For example , wheat grown in northern New South Wales ( NSW ) might move more efficiently to Brisbane , in Queensland , than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales , it said . Similarly , southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong , in Victoria . Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment , it said . The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential , although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained . An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier , Quebec , for a 60,000-tonner .

Ramon Diaz , Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government ( PCGG ) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126 pesos per share for the block , held in trust by the UCPB . " It looks good , " Diaz said . But he added several issues , including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares , had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the sale . The PCGG 's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted SMC 's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the UCPB group . The commission said it suspected the shares were actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco , an associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos . Cojuango , who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when he fled last year after Marcos was toppled , personally owned 24 mln shares in SMC . His holdings are also under sequestration . " The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers , " Diaz said . " Naturally we do not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies . " PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC 's Hong Kong subsidiary Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year . The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos . PCGG sources said SMC , the Philippines ' largest food and beverage manufacturer , has agreed to sell 14 mln " B " class shares from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a price of 150 pesos per share . The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso transaction , 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500 mln peso down payment , the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred shares in UCPB held by SMC , 210 mln pesos in uncollected dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to UCP B-controlled trading companies . The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share made by SMC for 33 mln shares , which grew to 38 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend declared in June last year . A spokesman for SMC said the company 's 15-member board met today to discuss the proposed compromise . The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board meeting , saying the dispute was under arbitration . President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership issue . The panel is due to submit its report by April 15 . Eduardo de Los Angeles , a government nominee in the SMC board , filed a formal complaint before the Securities and Exchange Commission last week , accusing Soriano and eight other directors of violating " fiduciary duty . " De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC 's board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan . REUTER

Lawson 's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling , dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates , analysts said . But the market 's reaction , testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson , was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish , they agreed . In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy , Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels , specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs . Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels , using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this . The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges , but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these . Markets were quick to react to the statement , chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson . But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson 's statement signalled a change in U.K. P olicy . Keith Skeoch , chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co , said , " the remarks have been blown out of proportion . Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue . " Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said , "there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor 's statement . " He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets , but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate , perhaps by as much as 10 pct . " It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election I do n't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate , " Brett said . Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading . This mood easily led to over-reaction , analysts said . " Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistak e , " one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said . Capel 's Skeoch said , " it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at . " " It is obvious that the government , as a member of the Group of Six , has agreed exchange rate bands . But they are not cut in stone , they can change with time ," Skeoch said . Brett said , " we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate . Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine . " Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks , however . Chris Dunn , economist at Royal Bank of Canada , said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar . Although about two-thirds of Britain 's trade is conducted with European countries , sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark , analysts noted . " Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe , " Dunn said . " It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System , it is seeking protection by shadowing it The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark , " he said . Analysts said sterling 's dip on currency markets following Lawson 's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term . " Over the next three weeks , a cut is out , unless we get some extremely good economic indicators , " Capel 's Skeoch said . Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March , the last after the March 17 budget presentation , and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards . REUTER

proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a merged telecommunications firm to compete for telecommunications contracts did not remove the group 's objections . The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press . Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against Japan 's <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which monopolises Japan 's overseas telephone business . But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of the two consortia would be impracticable . " They are like oil and water , " he said . The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have proposed that the two consortia band together . The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets . Watanabe 's latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves . The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake , up from an originally proposed three pct . Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered , the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same . Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at 374p .

main grain terminal was at a standstill today as members of the largest Dutch transport union FNV staged a lightning strike for the third day running . Pieter van der Vorm , managing director of Graan Elevator Mij ( GEM ) , which handles 95 pct of grain passing through the port , said their main Europoort terminal was out of action because of a strike by technical staff . The actions , in support of union demands in negotiations over a new labour agreement , began on Wednesday when grain handlers stopped work . Van der Vorm said that if strikes continued on today 's scale for some time vessels coming to unload grain in Rotterdam would face delays , but this was not happening yet . Wednesday 's actions left GEM 's facilities 40 pct operational , and there were only limited strikes yesterday .

ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year because increased plastic production in both countries has boosted demand and tightened supplies , chemical industry sources said . South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses just over 400 dlrs C and F per tonne , up from an average of 350 dlrs in the first quarter and throughout 1986 , they said . South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has risen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month , and the country may face difficulties covering the extra volume , they said . <Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp> , a producer of high density polyethylene ( HDPE ) and polypropylene , will more than double its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from 4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this month , the sources said . <Honan Ethylene Corp 's > import requirements have risen to 8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strong demand from <Honan Petrochemical Co> , which makes HDPE and ethylene glycol , and <Hangyang Chemical> , which produces low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer , they said . But Japan 's ethylene plants are already operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic demand , the sources said . " And even if Japan had the additional ethylene , there is a logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels to ship it to Korea , " said one trading house source . Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative sources to supply South Korea 's needs , including Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Mexico , they said . But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to keep it in a liquid form , they said . Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene industry in order to cope with the additional demand , despite rising prices , trading house sources said . South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase its ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year by the end of 1989 , so the strong demand surge for imports is only a medium-term trend , they said .

A National Bank spokesman said the latest adjustment would bring the rates closer in line with currently prevailing interbank interest rates .

forecast that British Petroleum Plc <BP.L> may have to close its refinery in Gothenburg because of an anticipated worsening of the Swedish petroleum industry 's competitiveness .

The committee said the BP refinery , which lacks a de-sulphurisation plant , was likely to be closed or sold unless costly investments were made to enhance the facility 's capacity to refine a broader range of products . But the committee noted that capacity utilisation had in recent years been above that of the European refining industry on average .

Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued . Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week 's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that " The Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments . " Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany 's exports . Stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy . " No-one would benefit if , after years of over-valuation , the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme , that is , strong under-valuation , " he said . Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors . Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord , Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published . The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene . Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered . He said he had nothing further to add . Stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that West Germany was now no longer under any pressure from the U.S. Government to stimulate its economy . He declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said , " You must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in Paris . " The minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to Washington that West Germany 's nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows . Stoltenberg noted that in 1986 Bonn 's exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct . West Germany 's imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year . However , Stoltenberg said that in real terms West Germany 's exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct . In this way West Germany had made its contribution to economic stability , Stoltenberg added . Stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating . He said it was too early to revise official forecasts for West Germany 's economic growth this year . The government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in Gross National Product . The Kiel Institute , a leading research body , is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct . Stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed . REUTER

closest aide , Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman , will not change the course of Washington 's domestic and international economic policies , U.S. officials said . Darman , who has worked alongside Baker for six years , was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation . U.S. Officials said Darman also played a key role in shepherding President Reagan 's sweeping tax reform plan through the U.S. Congress . But they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure , to the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Brothers , signaled the Baker team was breaking up , or that the Treasury Secretary himself might leave soon . " It really does not mean that , he took the opportunity as it came up ," one official said . Another commented , " B aker will miss him , but he 's not going to stand in his way . " There has been widespread speculation since last autumn that Darman sought a Wall Street job . Officials said Darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out . Baker acknowledged Darman would be sorely missed . "Dick Darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss , " he said . U.S. Officials admitted Darman 's absence would be an undoubted blow to Baker , who has relied on him for policy advice , both at the White House and , in Reagan 's second term , at the Treasury . One aide once described Darman as " indispensable " to Baker . Baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and Darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as Baker 's leading theorist on this issue , favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations . Earlier this year , monetary sources said the U.S. Treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system . But a U.S. Official disputed the assessment that , with Darman gone , Baker would abandon international initiatives . Baker 's work as head of Reagan 's Economic Policy Council , spearheading trade policy , and his skills in negotiating with the Democrat-controlled Congress will go on as before . Darman 's strength was not as an economist , but as a political strategist " and that 's Baker 's strength too , " the official said . There were already indications that Baker , who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers , has moved swiftly to find a successor . One possibility is that Baker might turn to George Gould , who holds the number three Treasury position of Under-Secretary . Gould , another close confidante , has known Baker for years . Before joining the Treasury in November 1985 , Gould was a partner at the Wall Steet firm of Wertheim and Co and formerly headed Donaldson , Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp. The Darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , where many policies Darman helped shape will be debated . He helped Baker devise the September , 1985 Plaza Agreement , when the United States , Japan , West Germany , France and Britain curbed the dollar 's strength . The pact was a major turning point in U.S. Policy , ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets . Darman also worked on some other Baker initiatives , like the Tokyo Summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent Paris Agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth . These policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between Japan and West Germany 's trade surpluses and the United State 's massive trade deficit . That policy goal still remains a prime objective of the Reagan Administration and will not change with Darman 's departure . REUTER

and central bankers meet in Belgium this weekend to discuss strengthening Europe 's joint currency float amid continuing worries about turbulence on foreign exchanges . Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens , who will host the informal talks , told Reuters the ministers and central bank chiefs would discuss the situation on currency markets in the light of the February agreement among leading industrialised countries to stabilise exchange rates around present levels . In an interview , Eyskens said he felt the Paris accord between the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada had proved itself " more or less workable . " But doubts over its effectiveness and durability have been growing since fears of a trade war between the United States and Japan over computer microchips pushed the dollar to a record low against the surging yen early this week . The talks , at the Belgian resort of Knokke , are being held to coordinate the EC 's positions on monetary issues and Third World debt ahead of the Spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington next week . The EC gathering begins tonight with a dinner but the main discussions will take place tomorrow . Continued international currency turbulence could undermine plans for reinforcing the European Monetary System , the joint float holding eight EC currencies within narrow fluctuation bands , which will feature high on the weekend agenda . Eyskens has repeatedly said that Europe needs a period of calm on world currency markets , and in particular a more stable dollar , before it can set about strengthening the EMS to make it more resilient against exchange rate swings . The EMS has been taking a battering over the last year as the falling dollar has sent funds surging into the dominant EMS currency , the West German mark , forcing ministers to undertake two major realignments of parities within nine months . In the interview , Eyskens made clear he was hoping for a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the eight-year-old EMS on the basis of proposals for bolstering it drawn up by the EC 's Monetary Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors . The committees were asked to come up with the proposals after the last reshuffle of EMS exchange rates in January . Eyskens repeated calls for the European Currency Unit , the fledgling EC currency at the core of the system , to take over the mark 's dominant role in the EMS a proposal that has met with a cool response in West Germany . He said EC Commission President Jacques Delors would report to the meeting on problems raised by plans to liberalise capital movements fully within the 12-nation bloc by 1992 , such as the need for harmonising taxes and banking controls . Eyskens said liberalisation of capital movements without strengthening the EMS would be an element of destabilisation in the Community . He said the crucial issue in the debate was whether member states were willing to push further towards the EC 's goal of monetary integration on the basis of an EMS that included management of exchange rates by some kind of common institution , instead of by national central banks as at present . Plans for the creation of such an institution , foreseen by the EMS 's founding fathers , have been thwarted by the reluctance of some countries , notably West Germany , to gove up their sovereignty in the monetary field . EMS development has also been held up by Britain 's refusal so far to join the system 's core exchange rate mechanism . REUTER

more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by Henley Group <HENG> , which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate , analysts said . Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week , but analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention . Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties , which hang in regulatory limbo . Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents , while its long-term debt to capital was just over 25 pct . " This gives them plenty of borrowing power , " he said , which could be used against an unwanted suitor . Henley Group 's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies . He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs . Santa Fe officials do n't appear concerned that Henley might launch a takeover . " I would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern , " one Santa Fe executive said about Henley . " I think it 's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm strategy with Santa Fe , " said Mark Hassenberg , who covers Henley for DLJ Securities . Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe 's land assets are likely to be realized slowly . They add that Santa Fe 's efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo , sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future . These realities , they said , support the Henley Group 's statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment . The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads , the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. The merger would create the nation 's second-longest rail road . Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds . The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the ICC 's concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to merge the lines . " My guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings , " Fischer said . " I believe they 've made an effort to satisfy the ICC 's objections , " he said . " But in doing so they have n't pleased everyone . Before they had Burlington Northern on their side , now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up . " If the hearings are reopened , analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say , and up to another year for the ICC to decide . Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback program begun in 1984 . It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of February 1 , when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding , a spokesman said . Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by Norfolk Southern , one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985 , one analyst said . James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight off the Henley Group with its cash and credit . Citing the share buybacks from Norfolk Southern , he said one of Santa Fe 's options , if threatened , could be to buy the Henley stake . " It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a low-risk , opportunistic investment , " Voytko said . "People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share , " said DLJ Securities ' Hassenberg . " But I 'm certain that in Ding man 's mind , the company is worth more than that in breakup value . " Reuter

its farm products market , while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture , a government report said . The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access . Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan 's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food . Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs , down from 61 pct some 20 years ago , official figures show . The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances . The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices , it said . The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers , the paper said . This could make it difficult to improve the industry 's structure , the paper said . To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels , Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting , it said .

Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued . Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week 's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that " The Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments . " Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany 's exports . He said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy . " No-one would benefit if , after years of over-valuation , the U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme , that is , strong under-valuation , " he said . Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors . Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord , Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published . The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene . Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered . He said he had nothing further to add . Reuter

interest rate increases and trade confrontations , finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation . The meetings , under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further , upsetting bond and stock markets . Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance . Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works . The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil , which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month . The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans . Separately , French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac , in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan , sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states . The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week 's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries . " There 's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries , because their position is so extreme , " a Reagan administration official said . He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue . The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative , which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems . The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar , U.S. trade and budget deficits and other problems . At the same time , the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct . The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself , continuing its expansion for a fifth year , and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies . These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties . In recent years , U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of developing country , allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange . But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit , running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs , and is pressing others to import more from developing countries . The discussions , from April six to 10 , will be wide-ranging , touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment , according to monetary sources . The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan , the sources said . The move accelerated the dollar 's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing . There is concern that the action , prompted by U.S. charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports , further undermining the international trading system . At the same time , the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities , the export mainstay of many developing countries . The so-called Group of Five industrial countries the United States , Japan , West Germany , France and Britain will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris , where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further . The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination . As part of the Paris accord , surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies , while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit . Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank , strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations . Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects . The new head of the Bank , Barber Conable , has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank , now being prepared . Reuter

wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough , Sartaj Aziz , Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister , said in an interview . No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price , he said . Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable . The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices , and the land would be better used for other crops . Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares . Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds . The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years , he said . Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop , harvesting of which is just beginning , is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes . This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year 's yield of 14.0 mln . He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly . The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993 , taking into account Pakistan 's annual population growth rate of more than three pct . Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes . The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes , Aziz said . This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes , which Pakistan will maintain at all costs , and a " strategic reserve " target of two mln tonnes . Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target , the surplus will not be exported at present , he said . The government wants to keep an extra " safety margin " until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption . New exports will be considered only in about a year 's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well , he said . The new domestic policy , introduced on March 15 , is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo . With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo . Under the old system , introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15 , some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply . Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer , the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills . The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended , Aziz said . Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system . The wheat price in Karachi , the most expensive Pakistani city , had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30 . Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption , but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran . Reuter

release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market , traders said . Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage , pointing out that at this week 's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted . The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand , they said , and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm . The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission . There has been growing concern that rising internal prices , triggered by heavy exports , were creating areas of shortage in interior markets . The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month . The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June . News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets , but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged . Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market . However , some traders believe these figures are overstated and , while some may still be held on the farm , the bulk of wheat is already sold . Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores . A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1 , leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes . Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes , leaving about 753,000 tonnes , traders said . This season 's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August . The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes , a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season . Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes . The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season , but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25 , traders said . Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/M arch 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley . This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season . The market is expecting prices , particularly wheat , to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season . If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further , feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage , traders said . Reuter

Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp 's headquarters protesting Dart 's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of Supermarkets General <SGL> . Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and also owns Rickels home centers . The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid because " workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the current takeover mania . " A Union statement said " We do not intend to allow our members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General 's executives and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions . " Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington , which last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc. The Hafts lost , but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in profits , analysts estimate . The union said that Dart 's Safeway bid forced a major restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and caused a loss of thousands of jobs . Reuter

" Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger partners , but will respond to serious inquiries . " We are determined to follow our plan to restore this company to profitability , " he said .

breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week 's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard , political sources said . Howard , who leaves for Japan tomorrow , told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit . Meanwhile , Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm 's bid to win a significant role in Japan 's telecommunications market , government sources said . Tensions have risen following Britain 's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions . Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Pl c , government officials said . But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone 's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger , they added . Reuter

expressed concern that trade protectionism , at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan , might spread throughout the industrial world . But in an interview with Reuters , Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war . Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets , arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth . " We have , in fact , been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world does n't close at the same time ," he said . He said the U.S. action against Japan was " a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy . " The interview came just before next week 's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund . Referring to Brazil 's recent interest payments moratorium , Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched . He said the Bank , which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams , roads and sewers , will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform . The Bank has increased these loans , in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets , encouraging foreign investment and reducing government 's role in the economy . " We 're comfortable with adjustment lending , we expect , however , that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio , " Conable said . He made clear , however , that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time . He noted , " the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt . " Conable , is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year . He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October , 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank . Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank 's organization to be completed in the next several weeks . He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based , in part , on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency . the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable , and is being closely-watched by the agency 's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities . " I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow , " Conable said . However , he said " I do n't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I do n't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose . " He said , however , that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis . Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency , the International Monetary Fund , was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues . On a personal level , Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that " I do n't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development . " He added , " so I do n't feel a great calling to personalize the institution . " On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa , Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region , noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank 's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa . Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations , like those in the Sub-Sahara , during next week 's meetings . Reuter

detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar , economists said . U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000 , less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected . Manufacturing employment fell 25,000 , compared with February 's 50,000 gain , while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February . " The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter ," said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. " This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters . " " The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy ," he said . " They will not ease as long the dollar is weak , but clearly they ca n't tighten . " David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected . While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct , he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct . Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000 , compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 . " There 's momentum in first quarter labor force activity , but less than assumed , " he said . " Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best . This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes . " In March , the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February . Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level , totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February . The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile , electrical and electronic manufacturing . Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs . Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead . Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts . Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct , to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters . He said the March drop in industrial activity " is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP . " Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March . They expect only marginal gains , if not small declines , for these indicators , compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income . Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts , which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January . The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct , its lowest level since March 1980 , from 6.7 pct in February . But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force , which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February . " This just means that there were fewer people looking for work , so the drop in unemployment does n't mean much ," he said . He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct , but " it does suggest they ca n't afford to tighten to quickly eith e r . " The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains , just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February , Slifer said , but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth . Economic growth remains sluggish , but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week . " At some point they will be more inclined to ease , " he said . For the time being , however , the March employment report " increases the likelihood they wo n't tighten , regardless of the dollar .

Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed . Specifically , the agency said those making tender offers for companies ' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid . Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions . As a result , a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached . In an interpretation of current rules , which officials said clarifies the SEC 's present position , the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived , even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so . The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a " material change " of the tender offer under U.S. securities law , SEC officials said . The SEC has already said that other specific material changes , such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered , made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer . The length of the extension , which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer , was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived . SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case , but would generally be between five and 10 days . The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer , denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information . Officials declined to identify the two offers . " If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer , it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination , " the SEC said . Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days . Reuter

packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada 's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn , industry analysts said . They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year 's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct . On Canada 's stock exchanges , energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983 , with many issues trading at record highs . " This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive , " Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said . Financial statements from Canada 's major oil companies , culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd 's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week , painted a bleak picture of last year 's results , analysts said . " But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history . The stock market is the indication of the future , " Gobert commented . The Toronto Stock Exchange 's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986 . Among Canada 's largest oil companies , class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A> , 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON> , is trading at 71 , up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4 . Shell Canada Ltd , 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group , is at 40-1/2 , up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4 . Texaco Canada Inc <TXC> , 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX> , is at 34-7/8 , up from a low of 24-1/2 . Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada 's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs , based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel . " However , if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel ...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher , " analyst Plexman said . " Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year , the gain should be significant , " he added . Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986 , when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs . But one industry source does n't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed . Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987 , after dipping about 60 pct last year . Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and does n't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices . However , several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts . Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week , assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels . " The industry 's outlook for 1987 is positive , but not robust , " Texaco Canada said in its annual report . " While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable , continued volatility is likely , " Texaco Canada added . In the face of short-term uncertainty , many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year 's lower levels , deferring most frontier exploration work . " The industry is becoming very selective in investments , very conservative and cautious , which is not unexpected , " Canadian Petroleum Association 's Maciej said . Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results . The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax ( PGRT ) 28 months earlier then planned . Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 . The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts , analysts said . " For a number of companies , the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made , otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more , " Maciej said .

gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary , the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year , causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31 . Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year , the report said . USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around . Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased , the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off . With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan , domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate , USDA said . " D evelopment of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers , " USDA said . USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S. " The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa , " the report said . World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87 , the report said , as higher per capita incomes , increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains . China , India and South Korea have increased output , while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s , the report said . Reuter

Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System ( EMS ) . But he added that arguments against joining had weakened . Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership , has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election , due by mid-198 8 at the latest . But Lawson , in answer to a question , told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers ' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership . In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS 's core exchange rate mechanism , there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered , he said . British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system , he noted . " We have to make sure it would work . " But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem . As an example he cited sterling 's role as a petrocurrency , which he said was diminishing . " That argument has clearly weakened , " he said . Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review . REUTER

finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System ( EMS ) against international market turbulence , officials said . " There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System , with all that implies , " Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort . The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January . The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency , the West German mark , sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system . But Eyskens said February 's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS . He told a news conference yesterday 's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries . They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable , both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins . But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC 's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors . He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates . The Belgian minister , whose country presently holds the presidency of the community , made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC 's long term goal of economic and monetary integration . " We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system , " Eyskens said . Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC 's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead . EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties . Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to " dedramatise " realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers . However , West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea . British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves . He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other 's currencies an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves . He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory . The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany , with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul . REUTER

ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan 's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan , The New York Times reported . The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May , three months longer than planned . The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time , as happens now , the paper said . The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz . It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq. U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles , but within striking distance , the paper quoted officials as saying .

industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986 , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said . Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd , the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report . Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels , as in 1986 . But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 , the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year 's 3.6 pct , it said . The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels , some destocking by end-users can be expected . If that happens , natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 , and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels . IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes , representing 98 days of forward consumption . This is about the same level as at the begining of the year . The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks . It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year . This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March . It is possible that final data will show a larger draw , particulary for March , it said . As crude production also fell , there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks , particularly at sea , the IEA said . Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986 . Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period . The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising , more or less in line with consumption , after declining for five years , the IEA noted . Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1 , down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption , respectively . Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1 , down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption . World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986 . This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/M arch from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies , the IEA said . Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter , plus 1.4 mln bpd of NG Ls , compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986 . Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd , against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986 . A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline , the IEA said . Saudi Arabia "s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd . REUTER

cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar , the economy and Federal Reserve policy , economists said . Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains , that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady , perhaps for several months . Until trends are clearer , " the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates , " said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate , the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy . Salomon Brothers ' Henry Kaufman said the bond market , highly sensitized to dollar movements , could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply . " The crucial question , however , is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur , " Kaufman said . " Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer , " said Philip Braverman , chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. However , Braverman said that , " from a longer term perspective , current ( bond ) prices provide a buying opportunit y . " Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data , key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday 's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high . Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism . Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday . The Irving economist noted that three times last year , in a similar " paroxysm of pessimism , " the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high . Within three to six weeks in each instance , however , Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points . Mitchell Held of Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear , which he considers unlikely . Held said that , since late 1986 , Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months . Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear . Naturally , that would mean a sharp bond price fall . " Yields could rise further over the next few months , but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we 've seen since the start of the year , " Held said . Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term . " The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stanc e , " said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology . That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion . The Lanston economists said , " The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar . " Minutes of February 's Federal Open Market Committee ( FOM C ) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy , foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift . However , economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming . There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday 's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged . This week 's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact . February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday , with March producer price data out Friday . There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index , a closely-watched economic indicator , rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct . A Friday rumor had put the number far higher . The index 's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct , translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987 . Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen . REUTER

This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23 . <Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed . AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company 's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid . AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC 's convertible notes . Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL 's planned one-for-one bonus issue . It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL. AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings , mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field . It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines . REUTER

industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986 , the International Energy Agency said . Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day , the IEA said in its latest monthly report . Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels , as was the case in 1986 . But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 , the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year 's 3.6 pct . The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels , some destocking by end-users can be expected . If that takes place , natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 , it said . IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes , or 98 days of forward consumption . This is about the same as at the begining of the year . The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks . Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986 . The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising , more or less in line with consumption , after declining for five years , IEA said . Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption , respectively . Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes , down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption . The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year . This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March . And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw , particulary for March , it said . As crude production also fell , there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks , particularly at sea , the IEA said . World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986 . This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/M arch from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies , the IEA said . Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period . A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline , the IEA said . Reuter

the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday , dealers said . Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning , with operators made wary by today 's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington . It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar . Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels , made at the Paris meeting on February 22 , a " vague statement , " casting doubt on operators ' assumptions that a secret target level had been set . Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged , "there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar . " One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks . " They were obviously regarded as being negative . And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative , " he said . Some early selling pressure softened the dollar 's undertone . Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators , dealers said . After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31 , interest and activity was likely to switch , dealers said . " We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencie s , " the U.S. Bank dealer said . Despite the softer undertone , traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings , dealers said . Aside from the G-5 session today , Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later . The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct , unchanged from those over the last several weeks . Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender , signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy . Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply . A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy , he said , contradicting some growing sentiment . Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957 . The yen 's unabated strength , despite the intervention , brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday 's 1.2480 .

In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries . " I put it to the ( post and telecommunication s ) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world , " Howard told reporters . " He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home , " he added . British frustration over the lopsided trade balance nearly six billion dlrs in Japan 's favour last year has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue , Howard said . Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan . " I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations , " Howard said . " We simply are n't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time . " Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard 's meeting with their minister . But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing , but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade . Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute , including Cable and Wireless , to be satisfied . Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue . " There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations , " he added , but gave no details . He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with . " But of course we 've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time ," he added . " What I 've made plain is we expect to see action . " Howard ruled out using powers in Britain 's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices .

" That adjustment should be large enough , in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States , to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead , " he said . Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow . Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure , the United States would have to slow its spending growth . It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital . " The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit , year by year , paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts , " he said .

stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) to enforce world trade rules . The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade . Today 's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September . The round , which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture , manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate . Smith called for boosting GATT 's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round . " The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy ," Smith said . " Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak , or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world econom y . " He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies . Smith , who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community ( EC ) officials , told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT 's importance and did not discuss specifics . " We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement ...Whether in formal or informal meetings , " he said . GATT 's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors . The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement . President Reagan , who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade , has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods . He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports . REUTER

Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth , but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing . " There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way , " Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee .

Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates . Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy . The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy . Mueller , a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria , noted that the Bundesbank 's decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targe tting . " Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy , " he explained . Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation . The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down . Lower money market rates , achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials , also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts , Mueller said . The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path , he said . " Finally , of course , and there is no need to keep this quiet , the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months , " he added . " All in all , the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut , despite suppositions to the contrary , " Mueller said . " Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates , especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad , rather than growth in bank credits , is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks , " Mueller said . Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy . Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate . In any case , the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. E c on omy , he said . But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank . Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank 's considerations , but reflect competition and other market conditions , Mueller said . A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock , the Bundesbank 's main money supply indicator . This does not reflect banking liquidity , but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank 's instruments , Mueller said . The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits , the harder it is to steer money supply . This has increasingly been the case recently , because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports . " If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates , as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively , it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows , " he said . Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high . In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct , down from 10 pct in the previous quarter . The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth , pointing to the success of the current policy , he said . But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities . " Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy nothing else , " he said . REUTER

West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January 's record 11.91 billion , with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply , the Bundesbank said . While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January , they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January . With German investors ' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks , only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions , after 11.2 billion . Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January . There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January . Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln . But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad , the Bundesbank said in a statement . Combining long and short term capital outflows , West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January . The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January 's 7.20 billion . Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two . In terms of current as well as constant prices , the narrowing of the surplus was progressing , the bank said . Germany 's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January , but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986 . Seasonally adjusted , the February current account surplus narrowed against January . While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year , imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices . Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct . In the balance of services , a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January . The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion , largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget .

decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June , Commission sources said . They said last week 's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26 . It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23 . However , it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later . The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising . However , the sources said , the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval . The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market , the sources noted . Following last week 's committee meeting , the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June . It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes , depending on the state of the market .

semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17 , industry analysts said . The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks , the analysts said . " Prices have gone up for memory components , the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry , " analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said . But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far , and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run . Others , however , were more optimistic , saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market , the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs . " We 've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS , and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS, " said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers . " Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching , " Kurlack added . Industry analysts said Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry , or MITI , had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year 's semiconductor accord with the U.S. The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods , alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market . But some analysts said Japan 's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword , and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. As production in Japan is cut , these analysts argue , prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips . U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured . " The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington , but at the same time they 're demonstating their muscle , " analyst Peck said . The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers . " I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers , " industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said . But analyst Peck said , " it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production . " He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI 's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment .

certificates , or " certs , " for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs , Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said . Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates , Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs . However , the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs , resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs , he said . Without the use of certificates , Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation , CCC . In addition , 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory , he said . When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government , Amstutz said , " GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs " of the certificate program . Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries , they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures . GAO underestimated this net loan activity , Amstutz said . " There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful , " Amstutz said . Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity , improved market price competitiveness , higher farm income , and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs , he said . Certificates are an integral part of USDA 's long-range market-oriented farm policy , he said . Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep.

should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities , according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate , one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989 , Carroll Brunthaver , president of Sparks Commodities , told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates . Thereafter , government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates , Brunthaver said . The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season a " zero certificate case , " where no certificate program was assumed , and an alternative case labeled " adequate certificate case " in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings . The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct . Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 , when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct . For the five-year period examined , government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs , or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case . The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs , or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs . The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined . The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels , these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash .

" Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong , " Robert Murphy , account executive at E.F. Hutton , said . Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report . Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war , with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions , and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot . Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York . Gold prices retreated at midday , but rallied before the close with support from the silver market , which was approaching two-year highs , traders said . Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade , while corn and wheat were mostly higher . Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country , and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain , which is limiting supplies . In addition , the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year . Monday 's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and , coupled with a lack of farm sales , provided support for the corn market , traders said . Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , while cattle ended lower . Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock , traders said , noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week . The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies , but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits , traders said . Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies . Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs , extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday , as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals . However , some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally , which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year .

Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress . At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition , an organization of U.S. legislators , David Cooke , chairman of the Ontario Parliament 's Select Committee on Economic Affairs , said the exemption would help trade relations . The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy . Currently , Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds . Cooke , a member of the Liberal party , told the U.S. congressmen , " I can understand ( the trade bill ) . I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world . " " I would suggest to you that we are your best friends . You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill , " he added . Canada is the United States ' largest trading partner , with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985 , according to the coalition .

However , the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified , would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord , which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February , to be strengthened . Currency target zones , or reference ranges , will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow , the Japanese officials said . The meeting , which is being held in conjunction with this week 's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions , will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord , the officials said . Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates , officials said , but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion . The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention . The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan , which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency , but also for the benefit of the United States as well . As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus , Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7 , the officials said . However , Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet , or parliament , despite the new fiscal year which started April one , the officials said .

finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market , but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures , financial analysts said . " If they ( the finance ministers ) give the market something really new to look at that is , some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement you could have a real boost in the dollar , " said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills . On the other hand , " anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar , " Mills said . Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar , nor will central bank intervention . " A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar , " said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM . " If there is no concrete resolution , they will be looking to sell the dollar , possibly down to the 1.80 mark level , " he said . Technically , most currency futures are poised for another rise , said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane . Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever , while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday . " Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you do n't need much to get things rolling , " Sloane said . In particular , the June Canadian dollar , for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommen dation , has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks , forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside . A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout , Sloane said , and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level . June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday . Mills noted , however , that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently , with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes . What has helped the Canadian currency , she noted , is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market , particularly from Japanese investors . Other analysts , however , said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally . " Something will be done at the ( G-5 and G-7 ) meeting to calm people ," said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics . The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade , Horner said . But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs , up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract , on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut , Horner said . The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday . Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings . The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen , Horner said . In yen futures , the bottom of the dollar 's range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract . June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday . If such a range does emerge from the meetings , " we will have one more rally in the yen , " Horner said . Reuter

said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth . In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here , Poehl said " It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit . " He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation , inflation and more depreciation if it took that route . Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy , accelerating tax cuts , cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth . He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year , but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament . But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark , he said . Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product , so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home . " A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth ," he said . Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors , including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade , had given some extra leeway . But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy . The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct , not the reported negative inflation rates last year , and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments . " For the time being , we will have to focus our policy more on the external side , and we can live with a more expansionary money supply . But we must be very careful , " he said . He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan 's trade surpluses , which affected European countries as well as the United States . Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries , saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated . All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level , and that further changes would damage growth , he said . " This was a remarkable change in attitude , especially on the part of our American colleagues , " he said . But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar 's value could overshoot . REUTER
