u.s. demands that japan open its farm products market will tell u.s. officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing u.s. farm exports to japan a senior ministry official said " imports from the u.s. would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers " the official who declined to be named said " japan is the largest customer for u.s. farm products and it is not reasonable for the u.s. to demand japan liberalise its farm import market ," he said agriculture minister mutsuki kato has said if the u.s. insists japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers australia and canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the u.s. he said end-users would also buy other origins grain traders said u.s. agriculture secretary richard lyng who is due to visit japan for talks between april 16-27 has said he will ask japan to offer a share of its rice market to u.s. suppliers and remove quotas on u.s. beef and citrus imports other countries are already cutting into the u.s. market share here australia the largest beef supplier to japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next march 31 imports of u.s. corn have fallen due to increased sales from china and south america while japanese soybean imports from brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the u.s. will remain the largest supplier u.s. feedgrain sales will also drop if japan opens up its beef imports since japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the u.s. japanese officials said an indication of the u.s. position came last december when under secretary of agriculture daniel amstutz said japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to u.s. agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business the u.s. has also asked the general agreement on tariffs and trade to investigate the legality of japanese import controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce pea nuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans to help calm heated trade relations with the u.s. japan 's top business group keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products but agriculture minister kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector " japan is the largest buyer of u.s. farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same tabl e " the official said reuter

fund managers redirect capital away from the united states and other traditional markets analysts said high short-term interest rates a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from japanese and u.s. investors analysts polled by reuters said fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on australia britain and canada as they diversify from volatile u.s. dollar instruments they said a one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 u.s. dlrs all illustrated the inflow official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from japan and the united states " these people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they do n't know what to do with it some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability " national australia bank ltd economist brian hamley said " there is a 'flight to quality ', " hamley said " australia may not be in the best ( economic ) position but there are n't too many other countries where you 'd want to put your money " the stronger australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the u.s. unit analysts said " we 're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the u.s. where some people would be concerned about the value of the u.s. dollar " lloyds bank nza ltd chief economist will buttrose said " why not put the money in australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stabl e " but turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said " it will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy ," buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government 's promised tough economic statement on may 14 while happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow particularly the japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said " it will remain very edgy money if something was not to be delivered if the statement was n't considered tough enough one might see a substantial outflow " buttrose said offshore investors are eager to see australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said " they are giving us the benefit of the doubt and i think they would like to leave the money here " buttrose said reserve bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in australia and the need to shield japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations reserve governor bob johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their " eyes off the yen " because of the crucial role of japanese investors analysts said they believed the reserve bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen apart from its recovery against a weak u.s. dollar the australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks offshore buying has also played a role in the booming australian share market it has followed wall street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector the key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period the property sector is also sought after with japanese companies that have invested heavily in the united states in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field analysts pointed to the recent sale of sydney 's five-star regent hotel to japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought " they think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment australia needs " buttrose added reuter

to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants oil companies such as ashland oil inc <as h> the kentuck y-based oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy " i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period " said paul oreffice chairman of giant dow chemical co <do w> adding " there 's no major plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones " analysts say the chemical industry 's biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year u.s. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30

speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in 1985 when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong u.s. dollar dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs " i believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it " oreffice said gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the u.s. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987 last year the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs a 54 pct leap from 1985 the turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said pace 's john dosher dosher said last year 's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost u.s. chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early 1980s finally virtually all major u.s. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses the restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts gaf which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire union carbide corp <uk> recently offered three billion dlrs for borg warner corp <bor> a chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse w.r. grace <gra> has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers " companies like dupont <dd> and monsanto co <mtc > spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated " dosher said " but i think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market " some top chemical executives share the concern " the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes " gaf 's heyman cautioned " the shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised specialty businesses do not stay special long " houston-based cain chemical created this month by the sterling investment banking group believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend chairman gordon cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of dupont 's conoco inc 's chemical business has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants along the texas gulf coast the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products " this kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous high-margin business ," cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually garo armen an analyst with dean witter reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the u.s. economy continues its modest rate of growth reuter

called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey pre-released here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements " central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them ," he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987 koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off " in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity " koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive u.s. current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of u.s. imports and a sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the u.s. and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect " h ence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term " koehler said a reduction in the u.s. current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp " in germany this did indeed happen in 1986 " koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the u.s. current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the u.s. but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the u.s. when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped " the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions " koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said reuter

foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s according to john h. lichtblau president of petroleum industry research associates lichtblau speaking at an alternative energy conference here said the u.s. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much as 52 pct of its oil by 1995 surpasssing the previous high level of 47 pct in 1977 " the long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is inevitable " lichtblau said as much as 30 pct of u.s. oil imports in 1995 could come from opec nations he said lichtblau said the u.s. depended on foreign suppliers for 33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to 40 pct by 1990 " however the rate of this growth can be affected positively or negatively through government action or inaction " lichtblau said he said that one of the government 's negative actions is the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash flow for oil exploration lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices " an international floor price adopted by all or most industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective measure and would be much less distortive for the u.s. than if we imposed it alone " lichtblau said development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic fuels as well as increased development in alaska could lessen u.s. dependency on foreign oil lichtblau said a potential for alternative supplies could limit the willingness of opec nations to raise oil prices he said lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer tax abatements for oil drilling to fill the strategic petroleum reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans for alternative energy reuter

cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the u.s. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability gains were most pronounced on the commodity exchange in new york where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce a key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the u.s. dollar said steve chronowitz director of commodity research with smith barney harris upham and co. in new york the dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value and despite reports of intervention by the u.s. federal reserve bank traders said traders said it appears that the industrial nations known as the group of seven lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets "maybe they have some ideas or plans " said chronowitz " if they do it 's not evident " " it looks like there 's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be "one way or another we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economie s " as a measure to correct the mounting u.s. trade deficit chronowitz said " i think the markets believe and have believed for a long time that the only recourse is to reflate at some point it 's going to be a long and tedious process but that 's what 's happening " he said the falling value of the dollar makes u.s. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers stimulating demand at the same time traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge said marty mcneill a metals analyst in new york with the trading house of dominick and dominick the reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets as grains livestock and cotton posted broad gains traders at the chicago board of trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand after the close of trading the agriculture department raised its estimate for grain imports by the soviet union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the chicago mercantile exchange while live cattle were moderately higher analysts said several factors boosted hog prices they said hogs have n't been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals reuter

federal reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings wednesday data out today show net borrowings from the fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to wednesday up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct "one could make a case that the fed is firming but it probably is n't " said william sullivan of dean witter reynolds sullivan said some may assume the fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-wee ks to wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months however the dean witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings " some might argue that the fed was firming policy but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and did n't quite make it " said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets a fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended wednesday still mccarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed the fed took no market reserve management action last thursday and friday the first two days of the week it added temporary reserves indirectly on monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via system repurchases on tuesday and wednesday based on fed data out today economists calculated that the two-day system repurchase agreements the fed arrranged on tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs they put wednesday 's overnight system repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs " it is quite clear that the fed is not firming policy at this time ," said larry leuzzi of s.g. warburg and co inc. citing the view shared by the other two economists leuzzi said the fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the united states and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders "those who believe the fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled " said mccarthy of merrill lynch he said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday 's washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid in fact currency dealers said there was nothing in wednesday 's g-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the united states and japan the economists generally agreed that the fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct this is about where the rate has been since early november " i 'm not so sure that the fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar as some suspect " said sullivan of dean witter if it is however he said that fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously reuter

markets with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar 's wake is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead economists said for two years the markets had hailed the dollar 's decline as the cure-all for the u.s. trade deficit interest rates fell sharply and wall street became a one-way street up but that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe fed chairman paul vol cker 's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse " vol cker 's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous now he 's got it " said david jones economist at aubrey g. lanston and co inc. the dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the group of seven finance ministers in washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances short of further depreciation of the dollar bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar 's slide will rekindle inflation scare away foreign investors and force the fed to tighten credit the inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce while the spike in interest rates pulled the dow jones industrial average down by 33 points to 2339 norman robertson mellon bank chief economist called the markets ' instability frightening he believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that " once you start the ball rolling it 's difficult to stop " " there 's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession the markets are in a panic " stephen marris of the institute for international economics in washington has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in february 1985 could turn into a nightmare " we 're still more or less on track for a hard landing but the agony may be fairly drawn out " marris told reuters marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession the stock market 's reaction today and its sharp drop on march 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about the fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline marris said he has forecast a drop to about 125 yen marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar 's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen the floor that the market believes was set as part of the g-7 paris agreement in february robertson at mellon by contrast said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on japanese electronic imports raising the specter of a debilitating trade war many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed excessive consumption in the u.s. reflected in the massive budget deficit but in the short term given the failure of the g-7 and of central bank intervention some feel that the fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar " the only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad at least by japan ," said lanston 's jones marris expects the fed to act quickly to raise interest rates even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for american farmers latin american governments and others but robert giordano chief economist at goldman sachs and co scoffed at the notion " it 's ridiculous to think the federal reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency this is yen strength not dollar weakness " he said giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the u.s. budget deficit " we 're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to gnp in history this year and nobody cares " he said noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater he said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year but for now market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out " put on your helmets " giordano said reuter

lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the federal reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar economists said in what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984 most banks in early april lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money that spread has narrowed again " a prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight " said robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc. brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks ' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point he said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last october until it fell below one point and triggered the april prime rate rise at most banks " we could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week " said david jones of aubrey g. lanston and co. " we 've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future " said allan leslie of discount corp. " based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now ," said harold nathan economist at wells fargo bank however he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates nathan believes the fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar he said " if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high a prime rate rise could occur at any time " fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle u.s. inflation as the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen friday currency traders said the fed and other central banks supported the dollar in addition to buying dollars outright another way to stabilize the u.s. currency would be for the fed to push u.s. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates based particularly on the fed 's reserve management actions on friday and today nathan of wells fargo said " it has become clear that the fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market it is supplying fewer reserves than are needed " bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply friday and today on heightened speculation that the fed is gently firming monetary policy that was because the fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected on friday the fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct with funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today the fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements " the fed 's actions on friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures " said jones of lanston " the fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar " jones said he believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now " but to have a major impact on the dollar the fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point " jones expects the fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and within four to six weeks to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct jones said a u.s. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by west german and japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar given likely fed policy firming he said both the yield on 30-year treasury bonds ( about 8.30 pct now ) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-june and nine pct by year 's end " the jury is still out on whether the fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar " said leslie of discount corp. he said tax-date pressures have been pushing up fed funds lately leslie said fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy reuter

should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection a confidential " executive summary " of a draft bank report on the indian economy was made available to reuters it suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of indian goods by making them more competitive the summary said " these reforms would result in ( domestic ) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen " the summary said foreign trade must play a key role in india 's transition towards a more dynamic economy liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose indian producers to foreign competition larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports " the main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers " the summary said an indian official told reuters the government was discussing the report with the bank a final report with some changes was likely to be ready by may but he declined to give further details the bank and industrialised nations will discuss the bank 's final report at a meeting in paris on june 22 and 23 to discuss aid for india in the 1987/88 year starting in june the summary said india 's gross domestic product ( g dp ) grew at an average five pct in indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87 which ended in march it said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings mainly from the private sector india 's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended march from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86 the current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86 but the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of india 's import bill india was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products the summary said the bank 's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position it said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87 indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments the summary said it did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued india " might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs " it said " an example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters ' profitability " the summary said it said such an approach had been successful in countries such as south korea colombia and turkey it would maintain the competitiveness of indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures earlier this year the indian government denied that the world bank asked it to devalue the indian rupee to boost exports reuter

weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action " until today we have anounced policies but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody " japanese trade minister hajime tamura told a news conference " from now on if a government comes up with a certain policy it must be followed by action " he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the united states the european community and canada in central japan last week the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen despite statements from the group of seven ( g-7 ) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade " we need credibility to gain confidence when we have confidence then we can have an impact " said tamura his colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets " the time has come now to act in step with the talk if you belong to a club you have to act in concord with the rules if you want to be credible " said ec external trade chief willy de clercq pat carney of canada said " we are meeting in a time of great trade tension what the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face " she said that next month 's meeting of the organisation of economic cooperation and development and the meeting of leaders of the g-7 nations in venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later " the media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results that is not the way it should be pursued " he said " what is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way " he said progress in personal contacts and understanding each others ' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions he said tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks currency stability was now essential but currency movements alone would not correct a u.s. trade deficit with japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year an 18 billion dlr ec deficit with japan in 1986 and a japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion he said trade retaliation protectionism and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dange rous he said the imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fis cal monetary trade and industrial measures and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules he said in this regard the policing role of the geneva-based general agreement on tariffs and trade world trade body must be strengthened he said the ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem the united states will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports the ec must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment all felt satisfied at the new progress in the canadian economy reuter

markets for the u.s. to take overt action to stabilize the dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough to help redress world trade imbalances economists and dealers said some experts believe that a half-point increase in the u.s. discount rate preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in tokyo and bonn would be enough to discourage sellers but many fear that more drastic action such as a u.s. issue of yen-denominated treasury bonds may be needed despite official warnings about the dangers of a further dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention the dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation touching a 40-year low of 137.25 yen in tokyo earlier today after closing here on friday at 139.30/ 40 the impact on other financial markets was devastating in tokyo the stock market suffered its largest single day decline in london gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs and in the u.s. long treasury bond yields surged above 8.80 pct and the dow jones industrial average fell more than 40 points in hectic early trading " the problem now is linkage this is not just a currency problem it is affecting all the markets " said one senior trader at a major u.s. bank up until september of last year international efforts to redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a dream the dollar was falling in an orderly manner world interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check in recent months however this strategy has begun to show signs of severe stress with the u.s. imposition of punitive tariffs on japan threatening to unravel this spirit of cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war " the markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is really difficult to stop a u.s. rate hike has become an inevitability " one currency dealer said " at this point nothing short of a fed discount rate increase ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by japan and germany would seem capable of stabilizing the dollar " said david jones of aubrey g. lanston and co inc. allen sinai of shearson lehman brothers inc predicted a 1/4 to 1/2 point u.s. rate increase before may 19 and a rise in u.s. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in the near future but many economists feared that any moderate u.s. rate increases which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts overseas would be too little too late " they should have done this 10 days ago it would have done the trick then " said one currency analyst " if they do it now it would be seen as a defensive measure not an offensive one it would show policy weakness not strength " added one trader in addition economists fear that a discount rate rise might place additional strain on a sluggish u.s. economy and tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate a u.s. discount rate increase would also fuel the protectionist fires in washington where the house is expected to pass a protectionist trade bill whatever compromises president reagan and prime minister nakasone can come up with during their summit later in the week " politically they ca n't really do it this week " said one currency analyst pointing out that if it failed to stabilize the dollar it would only weaken the u.s. negotiating stance even if the u.s. retains the upper hand economists and traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new initiatives from this week 's talks at best the experts see some sort of accord whereby japan will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to outsiders while the u.s. promises to lift its tariffs and support the group of seven dollar stabilization agreement but many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the market 's speculative selling fer vor which has now raised fears of weak overseas interest at next week 's quarterly u.s. treasury refunding program japanese and european investors have traditionally played an active role in these auctions which are expected to total 28 to 29 billion dlrs consequently thoughts are turning to the possibility that president reagan may try to remove foreign investors ' worries about currency risk by financing part of the u.s. budget deficit in yen or mark bonds rather than dollars while similar action by former president carter helped to stabilize the dollar in 1978 the white house is clearly reluctant to take such a step economists said this hesitance was amply shown last friday when u.s. treasury secretary james baker said "there might well be some who would view ( yen-denominated bonds ) as a lack of confidence by the u.s. in its own currenc y " baker added " therefore we do n't think it 's an appropriate thing to do " a foreign exchange analyst at a major japanese bank here shared baker 's doubts " d ollar defending measures are very unlikely they will confirm the dollar 's weak undertone and lead to further speculative dollar selling " he said thus it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to stop trying to fight the market 's bearish sentiment in a recent lengthy report economists at morgan guaranty trust co concluded " the dollar should be left free to trade at whatever level market

the dollar might force the united states eventually to unveil distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency monetary analysts and economists said treasury secretary james baker has acknowledged that the reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing yen-denominated u.s. government bonds to support the dollar but he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to take such an unusual step nonetheless monetary sources say the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration " it is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now ," baker said last week " in our view there might well be some who would view ( issuing u.s. yen bonds ) as in fact a lack of confidence by the u.s. in its own currency and therefore we do n't think it 's an appropriate thing to do " but if the reagan administration did announce measures they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action to reduce massive economic imbalances monetary analysts believe and like a currency defense package unveiled by the carter administration issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a rise in the discount rate now 5.5 pct the federal reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key rate so far chiefly some fed officials say because it could hurt economic growth another concern is the fragile international debt situation analysts who expect a currency support package are divided over its possible timing some even believe an announcement could come this week during a visit to washington by japanese prime minister yasuhiro nakasone " it would give some real focus to the visit and it might steady the dollar and prevent it from going down " said charles taylor an analyst with prudential-bache securities but monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the reagan administration would resort to measures which would bring to mind the troubles of president carter until very recently the current administration has urged a lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic policies collapsed but today washington 's policies are increasingly in question the carter plan was unleashed on nov. 1 1978 and it was a resounding success " this package really gave credibility to the administration to get the dollar up ," said robert hormats vice-president of goldman sachs inc and a former senior u.s. economic in the carter and reagan administrations the dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around 188 yen today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen " the problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really doing very littl e " hormats said of statements to support the dollar by u.s. officials several currency traders and foreign central bank officials think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying the dollar has declined far enough carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors who had lost confidence in the dollar to u.s. government notes the package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount rate to 9.5 pct drawings on u.s. monetary reserves at the international monetary fund and sales of u.s.-held sdrs to other imf members it was also supported by increased fed currency swap lines with other central banks and stepped up official u.s. gold sales stephen axilrod a former fed official who is now vice-chairman of nikko securities said " i think it 's very unlikely they would do that now " he argued that it was politically difficult to take action to support the dollar while japan and west germany have still to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies but most analysts believe a currency support package would only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers it could coincide with the june venice summit of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies the united states japan west germany britain france italy and canada hormats said he believed the currency has to decline slightly further for a package to have impact he said the seven nations ' paris accord to stabilize currencies was forged too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment " i think we 're nearing a point when they would feel ( politically ) comfortable doing this ," hormats said many analysts think the administration 's reluctance to act firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear of fanning protectionist sentiment in congress but hormats said "there will be a point at which the government of the united states shows it does give a damn for the dollar " reuter

the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in tokyo to a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late march the dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above 140 yen underpinned by higher u.s. rates and the fed discount rate speculation but most dealers expect it to weaken further which would put pressure on the bundesbank to ease interest rates japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa said yesterday the u.s. had requested japan to cut short-term interest rates the bank of japan was making efforts to do this he said adding the u.s. had not asked for a cut in japan 's 2.5 pct discount rate a move which bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said was not under consideration a call for a german move came yesterday from dutch central bank president wim duisenberg who said the dutch central bank favoured a cut in west german interest rates and would follow suit if it happened citibank ag said in its april report that another expected phase of dollar weakness would prompt the bundesbank to cut key money market rates in the next three to six months the bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on repurchase pacts since february with call money trading around 3.70 pct for much of april phillips and drew senior european economist richard reid said the bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further either with a lower fixed rate tender or a tender by interest rate allowing the market to set the rate " i 'm fairly confident we 'll see lower rates " he said reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate would have little impact on the german economy or fundamental exchange rates but could change market currency perceptions " a cut in german rates would n't be bad for the dollar but i think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was accompanied by other measures elsewher e " he said money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that the bundesbank would push down repurchase rates but said the bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the moment despite the liquid market seen for most of this month the dealers said the bundesbank was likely to move to an interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month that should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however they said the bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest rate tenders following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of april they said reinhard pohl head of the monetary policy section at the diw economic research institute in west berlin said the bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts " i do n't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little it would stop a wave of ( currency ) speculation " he said but a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the bundesbank to take some action he said pohl said the bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth some bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates to make the mark and mark investments less attractive pohl said the bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts which have swollen central bank money stock into securities which would take them out of the bundesbank 's key monetary measure a cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards they would therefore hold off buying bonds leaving central bank money stock swollen there are so far no signs that german investors are switching funds into long term securities as the bundesbank hopes they will berliner handels und frankfurter bank economist hermann remsperger said but phillips and drew 's reid said prospects of lower rates and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into german bonds which would in turn attract domestic investors werner rein chief economist at union bank of switzerland in zurich said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to drift lower in many european countries " the scope for lower rates is probably greatest in britain but more limited in west germany where we could see some consolidation " he said switzerland could be forced to match any cut in german rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark he said currency dealers in london said another half-point cut in u.k. bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the pound had shrugged off yesterday 's cuts and was still rising reuter

reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation 's swelling trade deficit a government study said in fact the federal trade commission ( ftc ) report said such protectionist policies could make u.s. products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re-exported in different forms " such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the u.s. economy " it said the 218-page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing u.s consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating u.s. industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said " although each industry 's competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry-specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit " the study said " to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy-wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth ," the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all u.s. industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s it also said it found a " fairly direct relationship " between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates u.s. economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries a lack of investment in u.s. industry declining research and development in u.s. industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the 1970s and u.s. antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit reuter

credit policies when its central bank council meets on thursday for its last session before the venice summit banking economists and money market dealers said the bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future they said the council will meet in saarbruecken and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 gmt. but bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside frankfurt and did not necessarily herald any policy moves bundesbank vice-president helmut schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in may and the dollar was stable against the mark schlesinger told reuters in tokyo where the bundesbank has opened a representative office that the west german economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month after the bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct allocating funds at 3.55 pct " they have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further but not with the discount or lombard " winfried hutmann chief economist of schroeder munchmeyer hengst investment gmbh said werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said german rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for west germany a further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand with companies swimming in liquidity chrobok said the bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates when this would be better held in reserve " the bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder " he said a cut in the discount or lombard rates to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month would have little practical significance dealers said the bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week 's venice summit but bundesbank president karl otto poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere " eyewash " economists said it was really up to the bonn government to cut taxes rather than for the bundesbank to ease monetary policy to meet pressure on west germany at the venice summit but with bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit it is hard to see how bonn could cut taxes further " the bonn government will be in a very weak position in venice because they ca n't risk increasing the deficit further " said schroeder muenchmeyer hengst 's hutmann bethmann 's chrobok said if anything is to happen before venice it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy " but i do n't expect any convincing measures " he said money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers starting in the week beginning june 15 two public holidays that week could also distort the market dealers said they expected the bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact but dealers said it was possible the bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55 that would not represent a tightening of policy however because the bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct dealers said on another issue poehl has said the bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the european currency unit ( ecu ) at one of its meetings soon saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to european unity as it is the capital of the saarland bordering france and was twice under french occupation this century but dealers said an ecu announcement was unlikely to come this week as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved for instance how german ecu accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes reuter

continue to grow in 1987 as sales of japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) said in its latest half-yearly review of the world economy the oecd said japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct but it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 " thus weakening the international adjustment process " it forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988 as a result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs the oecd outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to japan however oecd officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct gnp when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports the oecd outlook said " continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen " it said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth the oecd said japan 's gross national product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986 's 2.5 pct growth but it said japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year reuter

federal reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said but they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week 's unexpected eight billion dlr m-1 decline suggests it may this could influence the fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy a reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr m-1 decline for the week ended june 8 with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion instead m-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in m-1 for the week ended june 1 this means the nation 's money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said " m-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness " said bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc. while m-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth sullivan said fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in m-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates m-2 and m-3 which are seen as better gauges of economic growth latest monthly m-2 and m-3 data showed that as of may both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the fed 's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges if money growth does not accelerate fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said " d oes this mean that the fed abandons its current open market position no " sullivan said " but does this mean the end of tightening for the time being definitely yes " economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected most believed the fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs but they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the fed 's reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached a drop in may u.s. housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the u.s. economy are lagging while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in may producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears slifer said " if this continues we can entertain the notion of fed easing at some point " he said other economists said the fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth " it has been a number of years since m-1 has given good signs of what 's going on in the economy ," one said " i do n't think m-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the fed should ease " economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the fed toward easier monetary policy they said the fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth but sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late april " the fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar if it does then this gives them more room to ease " he said reuter

fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates and with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money the decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business while fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the u.k. they were the mainstay of the business in the u.s. up until only a few years ago but in the early 1980s interest rates soared u.s. lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts as a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge the survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds " we very much have the example of the u.s. thrifts in mind " said a spokesman for abbey national building society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages the rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation 's two largest building societies and by national westminster bank plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said the fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans " of course they are less profitable than other ( variable rate ) mortgages " said a spokesman for midland bank pl c which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans but he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because " it was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product " trustee savings bank plc ( tsb ) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year the 100 mln stg that tsb set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman " everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage " she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume in short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates if interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets but if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money household mortgage co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the june 11 elections on the assumption that a conservative party victory would help money market rates fall further according to duncan young managing director young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument but money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being he said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably however he said that when the household mortgage co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them this means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor for technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages in the u.s. where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years reuter

policeman for the nation 's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets david ruder a 58-year-old republican law professor at northwestern university in eva n ston ill. was named thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member u.s. securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall street 's most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some u.s. securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the u.s. corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by u.s. and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the sec 's ability to enforce u.s. securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency 's review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e. f. hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981 in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency 's enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission 's current priorities the sec currently has about 2,000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in 1934 the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john kennedy later to become the nation 's 35th president other former chairmen include william douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the u.s. supreme court in 1939 and william casey who served during president nixon 's first term and was reagan 's director of the

must double over the next five years if the mideast nation 's goal of economic independence is to be achieved said gad yaacobi israeli minister of economy and communication speaking before an american-israel chamber of commerce semi nar yaacobi said that in 1986 israeli exports to the u.s. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of israel 's total exports while imports from the u.s. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total " i am convinced that israel exports to the u.s. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years if we learn to function in the american marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality " yaacobi said while the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis european currencies is a " bottleneck to increasing exports to the u.s. " yaacobi said he expects israel to extend its recent trend toward higher u.s. exports in the last ten years israeli exports to the u.s. rose fivefold from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986 while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually the rate achieved until the 1973 yom kippur war he said that the u.s./israel free trade agreement passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994 would continue to facilitate the desired export growth dual agreements included in the fta allow israel to act as an economic bridge between the u.s. and europe enabling u.s. firms to export to europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in israel and vice-versa yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential since 1973 the u.s. has given israel 25 billion dlrs in aid but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts " which were imposed on israe l " he said short of achieving israel 's full growth potential however yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994 based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period reuter

the bank of japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said a rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said although bank of japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank 's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said but today 's stock market collapse prices fell nearly 15 pct means that the bank of japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market 's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase a senior government economist suggested that both the u.s. and japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in new york and tokyo stock prices " they need to support the stock and security markets " he said but bank of japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week both government and bank of japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago with the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said " there will be some impact on the real economy but it wo n't be that big " said another individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles and while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year 's economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said paradoxically it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said in deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the bank of japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said " that will at least take a couple of days if not weeks " he said reuter

surge in u.k. september sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the bank of england towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state economists said an acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending " in the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure " noted peter spencer u.k. economist with credit suisse first boston after an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data which compared won stg august rise u.k. government bonds ( gilts ) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities equity markets dropped sharply on the news touching a day 's low of 1,766.7 on the ftse 100 index after the data before staging a recovery sterling held its buoyant tone throughout u.k. money market rates in a similarly calm response resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct " with the financial markets doing what they 're doing that 's the last thing the bank of england would want to do " spencer said " the monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm the authorities are unlikely to put rates up ," said kevin boakes chief u.k. economist at greenwell montagu gilt edged boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure m0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from august 's 4.5 pct growth which he said must cause some concern at the treasury but " the fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign " noted paul temperton u.k. economist with merrill lynch capital markets he pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the m3 broad money aggregate to 19.5 pct in september from august 's 22 pct it was concern about credit growth which prompted the bank of england to engineer a one point rise in u.k. bank base rates to 10 pct in early august caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 4.9 billion stg july rise in bank lending temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of u.k. asset markets housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour he said in the light of the precipitous falls on u.k. equity markets in the past few days " there will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales " temperton said " almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues " he added " i think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the past ...we are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality " spencer said a u.k. treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information not just the bank lending adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing figures from the banking information service showed personal sector lending by u.k. clearing banks rose by 1.66 billion stg in september after a 978 mln stg august rise much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments reuter

central bank and finance minister gerhard stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank 's independence but a rare public row between the ebullient poehl president of the bundesbank and stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country 's already nervous financial markets bankers said poehl told an investment symposium in frankfurt last thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting poehl 's criticism saying west germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors " the obvious lack of coordination between the bundesbank and finance ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors " said one economist for a london broker who asked not to be identified bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time " there are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling " said commerzbank ag chief economist juergen pfister news on october 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad bankers said the bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan without consulting the bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market both poehl 57 and stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy helmut schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability in recent statements poehl has sounded more like schlesinger for years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices schlesinger now has a majority of support in the bundesbank council and since late summer poehl has had to represent his views bankers said " poehl is in a minority in his own house " said commerzbank 's pfister " poehl is in a dilemma he must follow a policy that is not entirely his own " said another economist the dilemma is that if german interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting west german exporters the dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the bundesbank 's new tack became clear in early october since last thursday united states treasury secretary james baker has criticized the bundesbank rate increases bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the u.s. and west germany in which u.s. officials talked down the dollar to force west germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more u.s. exports one way west germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 but financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for stoltenberg than he had bargained for the cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts the withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks but it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs the extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in meanwhile stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country 's worst political scandal stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of schleswig-holstein where he heads the ruling cdu party the state 's cdu premier uwe barschel had to resign after allegations of a " dirty tricks " election campaign led to heavy losses for the cdu in state elections barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in geneva last weekend police say the death appears to have been suicide cooperation between poehl and stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as poehl is in the opposition social democrats and was appointed by former chancellor helmut schmidt when poehl 's contract came up for renewal earlier this year chancellor helmut kohl 's cdu-led coalition government gave poehl another eight-year term werner chrobok managing partner at bethmann bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again but when poehl criticized stoltenberg 's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the bundesbank 's independence of government chrobok said reuter

still comply with last february 's louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior bank of japan official said and u.s. treasury secretary james baker 's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the bank of japan and finance ministry agreed in interviews " the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the baker comment will regret it later on " the bank of japan official told reuters the bank official said baker did not mean to talk the dollar down a lower dollar would harm the u.s. e c on omy he noted a finance ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the u.s. would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen the market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks the dollar closed in tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and 141.35 yen " behind baker 's remark was u.s. frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in west germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the louvre accord " the finance ministry official said he said that on the contrary baker wanted to avoid any further rise in u.s. interest rates because it would not only hurt the u.s. economy but aggravate the third world debt problem higher u.s. interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress u.s. stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the u.s. no longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the u.s. "that 's why baker did not fail to add that the louvre agreement is still operative " the senior ministry official said baker said in a u.s. television interview on sunday that washington would reexamine the louvre accord because of west germany 's increase in short-term interest rates the market at first interpreted this as indicating the u.s. would be ready to scrap the louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably west germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said but the market on reflection also noted baker 's additional statement that " the louvre agreement is still operative " and this caused some dollar short-covering in tokyo today the dealers said uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in tokyo currency markets the japanese monetary officials said baker 's undisguised pressure on west germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination the g-7 comprising the u.s. japan west germany britain france italy and canada have agreed to monitor each other 's economic policies and from time to time apply " peer pressur e " to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted " without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance baker would never have criticized the west german policy so openly " the ministry official said the u.s.-west german squabble over bonn 's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the louvre agreement the official said he also said japan has not received any specific request from the u.s. on its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher " this is because we unlike the germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons " he added reuter

gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the n.z. dollar independent economist len bayliss said bayliss a former economist with the reserve bank and the bank of new zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies the taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the n.z. dollar he said in a speech he added that the deficit for the year ending march 1988 could be much higher than the government 's 1.3 billion dlr forecast since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable bayliss said he would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax introduced in october 1986 but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation the government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added new zealand 's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-september against 18.9 pct in the year to end june the major deficiency in the government 's anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit bayliss said the government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit " the widespread belief that ( new zealand 's ) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based primarily because the government 's macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful " bayliss said reuter
