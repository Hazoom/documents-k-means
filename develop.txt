scheduled june session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices oil industry analysts said " the movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as opec thought they may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems " said daniel yergin director of cambridge energy research associates cera. analysts and oil industry sources said the problem opec faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets " o pec 's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way " said paul mlotok oil analyst with salomon brothers inc. he said the market 's earlier optimism about opec and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices but some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of opec production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last december " opec has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas fixed prices and set differentials " said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named " the market is now trying to teach them that lesson again ," he added david t. mizrahi editor of mideast reports expects opec to meet before june although not immediately however he is not optimistic that opec can address its principal problems " they will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil but in late march and april when demand slackens " mizrahi said but mizrahi said that opec is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd " analysts said that the next two months will be critical for opec 's ability to hold together prices and output " opec must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then " said dillard spriggs of petroleum analysis ltd in new york but bijan moussavar-rahmani of harvard university 's energy and environment policy center said that the demand for opec oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production " demand for their ( opec ) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is opec meeting this demand through current production " he told reuters in a telephone interview reuter

a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter weather and crop analysts said prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the soviet union appear dim at this point but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems analysts said but the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the soviet grain supply and future buying plans analysts of the soviet union said " from a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that the soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop ( than last year ) ," gail martell chief meteorologist for e.f. hutton said the next six weeks in the ussr 's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops martell and other analysts said " where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us ," an agriculture department authority on the ussr said the soviet union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill this would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the usda analyst said with a timely spring soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures this winter however snowcover in soviet grain areas has generally been excellent so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination " fall dryness may be a problem there 's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness " martell said precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern ukraine and below normal over the entire winter crop area she said recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill jim candor senior forecaster for accu weather said livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter analysts said the dry fall damaged pastures the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding they said " the soviets are not in a desperate situation they do n't have to buy ( grains ) now ," a usda official said but if the soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year 's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions more soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies he said bad weather during the next six weeks could push the soviets back into the market weather analysts said " a lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half " martell said reuter

analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program that gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees with the price outlook for both commodities so dismal traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances an announcement late friday that the usda will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized traders said here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the more attractive deal from the government they added cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago which should prompt many farmers in the south to put soybean land back into cotton one of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the south to soybeans which are easier to grow one commercial trader said reuter

yen 's sharp rise against the u.s. dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions japanese and european research officials said the officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five ( g-5 ) industrial nations told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan-u.s. trade axis into a japan european community ( ec ) axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september 1985 new york plaza pact between the u.s. japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely " you have to look at the dollar 's peak compared with now and that was well before plaza " he said on february 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen on september 20 the friday before plaza it was 242 since then despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story the european currencies are moving back up against the yen the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing in 1986 japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus last january japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms " the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the u.s. it is europe that is laying the golden egg " said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had a remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total japan-u.s. trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than u.s. firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems " this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries but therefore japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge " said azusa hayashi director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry " if you want my objective view i do n't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again ," he said reuter

deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation 's huge trade deficit u.s. trade representative clayton yeutter said speaking to the new york chamber of commerce and industry yeutter said " capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now " unless we get the budget deficit down we will not get the trade deficit down " he did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits private analysts have said that the financing of large u.s. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of u.s. treasury and to a lesser extent other u.s. securities as well " we 'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 but there 's still a long way to go " yeutter said he said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on u.s. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth u.s. competitiveness and the establishment of a " level playing fiel d " for trade the u.s. trade representative said the federal reserve under chairman paul volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down on the fiscal side yeutter said " the budget deficit is still our biggest problem " and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit in the international area he said that " our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth " commenting on japan which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the united states yeutter said " japan is just not doing the job on the import side " yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by commerce dept undersecretary of economic affairs robert ortner in a washington address to an export-import bank sponsored meeting ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most european currencies but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued " the market will determine the dollar 's proper value in the end " yeutter said however he added that if the u.s. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the u.s. trade deficit " the dollar will be the equalizer " yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers he said " there 's relatively little that congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem " protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by u.s. trading partners yeutter said " there is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation " yeutter said adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems reuter

yen 's sharp rise against the u.s. dollar is obscuring the fact that the japanese currency has hardly budged against major european currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions japanese and european research officials said the officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the group of five ( g-5 ) industrial nations told reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the japan-u.s. trade axis into a japan european community ( ec ) axis to the discomfort of europe in many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the september 1985 new york plaza pact between the u.s. japan west germany britain and france to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one but it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said the officials said that when the plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down the agreement simply helped it on its way senior ec financial expert in tokyo tomas de hora has watched the movements closely " you have to look at the dollar 's peak compared with now and that was well before plaza " he said on february 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen on september 20 the friday before plaza it was 242 since then despite massive bank of japan intervention and periodic market frights about further g-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down yet the ecu is now around 173.4 yen the historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story the european currencies are moving back up against the yen the close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing in 1986 japanese imports and exports with the ec both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen this gave japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus last january japanese exports to the ec totalled half of of sales to the u.s, against about a third in recent years trade with the u.s in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms " the basic meaning for europe is that japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them suddenly instead of the u.s. it is europe that is laying the golden egg " said de hora the ec is worried ec business also had a remarkable year in japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total japan-u.s. trade the japanese think ec firms are now more competitive than u.s. firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems " this currency alignment between japan and the ec is reflecting the excellent performance of the ec countries but therefore japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge " said azusa hayashi director of the first international economic affairs division of the foreign ministry " if you want my objective view i do n't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again ," he said

later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/ 92 or " de-coupling " provision to cover feedgrains and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited congressional sources said the disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop the bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments the administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year it is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee the sources said proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill committee staffers said the 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 est. a conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends march 30 farmers are now making their planting decisions so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented an agriculture department source said an expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week 's subcommittee hearing on the bill with subcommittee chairman dan glickman d-kan. saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary major commodity groups including the national corn growers the american farm bureau and the national cattlemen 's association have voiced strong opposition to 0/92 but proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers so it should be extended to other crops there will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat said gene moos aide to house majority leader tom foley d-w ash projected cost savings in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application moos said rep. charles stenholm d-tex. may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill " stenholm 's bill is not a rejection of 0/ 92 only of the timing " a congressional staff member said rep. arland stangeland ( r-minn ) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains reuter

suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987 the developing world 's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets economists said " that sounds like a reasonable strategy but there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation ," aldo roldan vice president for international services at chase econometrics said roldan told reuters that brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable " domestic costs have increased ( due to inflation ) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates " roldan said the chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like brazil where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs but he added " they are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels " analysts said a key factor in brazilian trade will be coffee and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world 's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance negotiations between international coffee organization ( ico ) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence " brazil would not tolerate a change in ico regulations which others wanted changed " one senior coffee dealer said the dealer who declined to be named said brazil wanted to preserve its market share at the end of the talks he said brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy brazilian sales the dealer said " if they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar ninety or eighty cents " he said new york coffee futures for may delivery settled 2.29 cents lower thursday at 104.68 cents a lb while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit president of the brazilian coffee institute jorio dauster told a press conference in rio de janeiro today that brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ico talks on export quotas many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up brazilian marketing efforts " they will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been " according to richard loewy analyst for prudential-bache securities inc. loewy believes the foreign debt problem a good crop plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the brazil soybean crop " brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they ca n't afford to store the crops " he said the chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large south american crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields " we are going to see a very rapid decline earlier than usual this year in our ( u.s. ) exports " loewy said tommy eshleman economist for the american soybean association ( asa ) said this year 's brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes versus 13.7 mln last year marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the u.s. crop to bad growing weather another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the u.s. government soybean loan rate offered to farmers who give crops as collateral eshleman said he said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan " we 're getting into a period when they ( brazil ) are starting to harvest and starting to export " eshleman said but he added it will be a while before u.s. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently jose melicias from the research department of drexel burnham lambert said brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation he said the debt situation was a major consideration " the brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storag e " he added asked if a return to an inflationary environment in brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops melicias said it would not make a big difference on other commodity markets brazil 's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest which could limit exports to the world market analysts said the country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar will give it little room to stretch exports they said brazil 's other major crop cocoa is in its third year of surplus " cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell so i do n't think they can start throwing

" that could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher " he added the u.s. benchmark crude west texas intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week the rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in february more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel " o il traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and opec was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota but now both of those assumptions have come under question " mckinley said yesterday the international energy agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the oecd area or in industrialized nations were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year iea estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by april one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes or about 74 days consumption industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by shell chairman peter holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike which kept refiners from buying officially priced opec oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price " this struggle between the companies and opec is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon i would imagine by about the middle of the month ( march ) ," the general trading manager of an international oil company told reuters in a telephone interview for its part opec has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output traders said a reuter survey estimates opec output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week also an earthquake in ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments " this will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there " mckinley said international oil traders said that other short-haul crudes such as north sea brent were also scarce because asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available mideast crudes earlier this week if this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries trading managers at several companies told reuters but there were skeptics who said they wondered how long opec can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues stephen hanke chief economist at friedburg commodity management said opec production was lower " because of the saudi cut ( to 3.1 mln bpd ) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas " he added " the saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota and the drain on the saudis will continue forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price " he added there are also signs of some opec crudes being sold in the spot market at below opec official prices traders said oil traders said nigerian brass river sold for delivery into the u.s. gulf at a price related to north sea brent which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality bonny light iranian oil is also surfacing in the u.s. gulf and the far east at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price " there is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals which are below official prices and this is probably being resold " one international trader said reuter

feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the house agriculture committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat congressional sources said the disaster aid bill introduced by rep. glenn english ( d-okla. ) sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat an agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers unless the english bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally they said if the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week sources said english has agreed to support an amendment by rep. charles stenholm ( r-tex ) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear agricultural aides to english said the congressman 's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers however if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat then english might consider an even greater cutback in the bill they said under a 0/92 plan farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments rep. arlan stangeland ( r-minn ) and harold volkmer ( d-mo. ) have both expressed interest in expanding the english bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains an aide said stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill but to be fair to all crops only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land economists said opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the house agriculture committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program reuter

needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in german public authority bonds higher this year bond market sources say " at the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates but how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigner s " one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in frankfurt said the sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs friday 's loan stock was the third this year already the sources noted it carried a 10-year maturity a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue this compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct but dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last may one finance ministry economist said " it is n't more it 's just the size ( of each bond ) which has increased " he added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt until recently federal issues sold very strongly abroad with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors with the recent stabilisation of the u.s. dollar however foreign investors have begun to back away from the market as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing having raised more than 18 billion marks the government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986 but bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion the sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently other factors including the government 's tax reduction program would also reduce income next year " the problem here will be the tax reform " the portfolio manager said he added that the government 's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings the sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other the portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term " kassenobligation " notes a finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year though many sources agreed they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect " i would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase " the manager said bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance with the bundesbank 's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on friday from 5.66 a week earlier but sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark " the demand was n't so good " a dealer for a german bank in london said the dollar 's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently some dealers said reuter

commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official 's comments also suggest that debtors ' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a " megabank " where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that " exit bonds " be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters " all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered " said the official who asked not to be named in october 1985 washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund ( imf ) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth " the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well ," said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u.s. debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis " we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively " the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a " megabank " which could swap third world debt paper for so-called " exit bonds " for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs he emphasised that the " megabank " was not an administration plan but " something some people have suggested.

discount window borrowings data released by the federal reserve today clearly indicate that policy is " on hold " and may not be changed for weeks or even months economists said " the fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy ," said john williams of bankers trust co. " these numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change " said william griggs of griggs and santow inc. fed data released today were all in line with economists ' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks the fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs up from 381 mln dlrs in the february 25 statement period but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that it said that banks ' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously finally the fed said that the m-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in february with the broader m-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and m-3 up an even three billion dlrs analysts said that m-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for m-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for m-3 february levels of m-2 and m-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the fed for 1987 the annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct there is no m-1 target " in the near term there is absolutely no reason for the fed to ease policy even apart from the slowdown in money growth ," said stephen slifer economist at lehman government securities inc. economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in march after february 's anemic growth rates however they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness commenting on february 's decline in the key m-2 aggregate slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks this number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while he said so february 's weakness is not likely to persist slifer expects modest m-2 and m-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during march griggs said that m-2 and m-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the fed economists said the fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves given the economy 's fragility in many sectors the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the fed will choose to raise rather than lower interest rates when it next changes policy "discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the fed can get them although fed funds held above six pct " said williams of bankers trust funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to wednesday up from 6.06 pct in the prior week the fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last friday 2.5 billion dlrs on monday and two billion dlrs on wednesday on tuesday it added reserves directly through two-day system repurchases williams and griggs agreed the fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven they said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs reuter

eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ( ecu ) has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe 's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world 's first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system 's founding fathers ex-west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d'estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters " the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common " said one economist who has closely watched the system 's development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system 's greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past 18 months as the u.s. dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut interest rates to slow the mark 's rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain 's failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government 's attitude is expected before the country 's next general elections due by mid-1988 meanwhile the system 's last realignment the 11th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec 's highly-secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change " technical measures wo n't be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level " said leo de corel of kredietbank 's economic research department economists say the system 's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict reuter

" it seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program " she said hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up she added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's zimmer of merrill lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres new crop corn prices at the chicago board of trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures reuter

february is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs from the unrevised january level of 1.29 billion market economists polled by reuters said statistics bureau february figures are out tomorrow the economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in january after a sharp rise in december when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs as an example they quoted wheat export volume which rose about 30 pct in february after dropping as much in january a lack of aircraft imports in february should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit the economists said other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments they said they said the australian dollar which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 u.s. dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs reuter

weighing rules for banks ' off-balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the u.s. and u.k. to japan juergen becker director of the bundesbank 's division of banking law and credit supervision said the u.s.-british proposals were interesting but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals " there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages " one representative of the german banking association in cologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank west germany 's four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of germany 's credit law which has been in effect since 1934 authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of 1984 the banking law has limited banks ' lending to 18 times shareholders ' equity plus reserves on a consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and interest swaps commercial paper programs currency options interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges the sources said the main value of the u.s.-u.k. proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk u.s.-british proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous this is the so-called market-to-market value but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks ' securities portfolios are zero for public authorities 20 pct for domestic banks 50 pct for foreign banks and 100 pct for other foreign and non-bank borrowers a further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the u.s. and the u.k. may put german banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the u.s.-u.k. proposals could far exceed the intent of the u.s. and british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a long-dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as a cross-currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead-manage mark eurobonds but as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks ' freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added reuter

showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full house of representatives in late april in a move to toughen u.s. enforcement of trade laws a key house subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices this bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of american industries and turn around last year 's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out u.s. products on the other hand congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties reagan 's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers republican bill frenzel of michigan said the subcommittee 's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects " but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill reagan and republicans would ultimately endorse frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements you 'll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough you 'll find poeple who think we have n't avoided violating agreements " in a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the house ways and means committee the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices it also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the u.s. economy ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski an illinois democrat insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the house wanted to pass a bill reagan would sign into law reagan last year had blocked senate consideration of a tough house trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill as an indication of his success white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters friday the administration still did not like some provisions but he added " generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation i think we are progressing very well " the first battle will take place next week when the full house ways and means committee considers an amendment by rep. richard gephardt a missouri democrat to force countries such as japan south korea and taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the united states the subcommittee limited the gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the united states will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices but would not automatically set off retaliation rep. phil crane an illinois republican and staunch free trader said he will try to further weaken the gephardt plan organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition afl-cio president lane kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill reagan would sign would not be worth passage in congress but rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement " i 'm not trying to write legislation to please lane kirkland i 'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president " in writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles rep. ed jenkins a democrat from georgia agreed to hold off his fight he intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide said reagan vetoed a similar measure last year house speaker jim wright a texas democrat is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition wright thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption for the most part the trade bill 's provisions toughen u.s. enforcement of trade laws the bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the united states at prices below the cost of production it also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence congressmen said the change would have required the u.s. international trade commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981 reuter

eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ( ecu ) has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe 's common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world 's first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system 's founding fathers ex-west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d'estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision-making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters " the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common " said one economist who has closely watched the system 's development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system 's greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past 18 months as the u.s. dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system another frustration has been britain 's failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government 's attitude is expected before the country 's next general elections due by mid-1988 meanwhile the system 's last realignment the 11th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec 's highly-secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change " technical measures wo n't be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level " said leo de corel of kredietbank 's economic research department economists say the system 's fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict reuter

showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full house of representatives in late april in a move to toughen u.s. enforcement of trade laws a key house subcommittee last week approved a toned-down version of legislation to require president reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices the bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of american industries and turn around last year 's record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit generally the bill 's provisions toughen u.s. enforcement of trade laws the trade bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the united states at prices below cost of production it also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence in writing the bill the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to reagan and said they intend to back amendments to " get tough " with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out u.s. products but congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade said the bill ties reagan 's hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers bill frenzel r-mi. said the subcommittee 's bill was not one "that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects " but he emphasized there was a consensus among lawmakers to work toward a bill reagan and republicans would ultimately endorse the goal of trade legislation was " to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements " he said in a key concession made at the urging of ways and means committee chairman dan rostenkowski d-il. the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced reagan to impose automatically quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices it also agreed the president may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the u.s. economy rostenkowski insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the house wanted to pass a bill reagan would sign into law reagan last year blocked senate consideration of a tough house trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year he only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw democratic leaders were determined to pass such legislation white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters late last week that the administration still did not like some of the bill 's provisions but he added " generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation i think we are progressing very well " the first battle will take place next week when the full house ways and means committee considers an amendment by rep. richard gephardt d-mo. to force countries like japan south korea and taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the u.s. the subcommittee limited the gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the united states will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices but would not automatically set off retaliation organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition afl-cio president lane kirkland this year angered the administration when he said any trade bill reagan would sign would not be worth passage in congress but rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate by saying " i 'm not trying to write legislation to please lane kirkland i 'm trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president " rep. ed jenkins ( d-ga. ) intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry an aide said reagan vetoed a similar measure last year house speaker jim wright of texas one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low-priced foreign competition last week renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption reuter

and operators may push the currency to a new low unless japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by reuters said here " the dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level " a senior dealer at one leading bank said the dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 151.50 yen six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in paris in february to foster currency stability some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of u.s. fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced japanese purchases of u.s. treasury securities needed to finance the u.s. deficit dealers generally doubted whether any economic package japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further u.s. steps to weaken the dollar under the paris accord tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said if no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the u.s. congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said the factors affecting the u.s. currency have not changed since before the paris accord they added " underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish u.s. economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by brazil 's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the reagan administration as a result of the iran/contra arms scanda l " said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank " there is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year " said chemical bank tokyo branch vice president yukuo takahashi but operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention dealers said there were widespread rumours that the u.s. federal reserve telephoned some banks in new york to ask for quotes last wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks the bank of england also apparently sold sterling in london when it neared 1.60 dlrs on wednesday they said but other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar 's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars however first national bank of chicago tokyo branch assistant manager hiroshi mochizuki said " the dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of march " other dealers said the u.s. seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on march 31 because a weak dollar would give japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of u.s. treasury securities u.s. monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said reuter

against european currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top bundesbank official said board member leonhard gleske also told a forex association conference current exchange rates of major currencies " can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective " he said the recent paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the group of five and canada may herald " an era of greater exchange rate stabilit y " the paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level " at present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies and the yen " gleske said he said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as canada korea taiwan and hong kong and further falls there may still be necessary but " a further dollar depreciation against major european currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value " he said in fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers gleske said first in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as japan and west germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses second in the united states it could damage investors ' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits gleske said gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts " both within countries and between them " for instance the u.s. reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones if target zones were established this would put " pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities " he said gleske added " targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities " commenting on the paris currency accord gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained these chances " seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead " gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot " he said this " would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible " monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said reuter

statistics for february cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates but economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months and after a steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom u.s. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in february to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in january it was the highest pace for starts since april 1986 the rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in january " february 's weather is usually more adverse for home building because of seasonal factors it 's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road " said allan leslie of discount corp. the housing report is seaso nally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks as a result milder temperatures inflate the statistics economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month but several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer " builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'let 's do it now ', " said mark obrinsky of the u.s. league of savings institutions in washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building but obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the u.s. economy he expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in february last november fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct as expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector the multi-family area which typically represents rental units remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective january 1 s ing le-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate " strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job but we 're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potentia l " said ward mccarthy of merrill lynch capital markets mccarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in u.s. employment industrial output and retail sales in february may cause some observers to start waving " four pct gnp banners " for the first quarter gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter but mccarthy who still expects first quarter real gnp to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future " the big story is the inventory re-building that 's going on now not all of which is intentional " he said for example u.s. automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in february compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln thus while inventories could contribute to gnp in the first quarter they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second he said " if most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter ," agreed allan leslie of discount corp. he is still evaluating first quarter gnp prospects federal reserve chairman paul volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed " at the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second " cautioned joe plocek of mccarthy crisanti and maffei inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct reuter

last year are rapidly deflating the united state 's natural gas bubble which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch industry analysts said faltering deliverability of natural gas a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities could more than double the current u.s. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990 some analysts said the need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the gulf of mexico 's offshore waters where some of the nation 's largest gas reserves are located " we think an upturn in u.s. drilling is imminent " said james crandall an analyst with salomon brothers inc. "many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they 're betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two " the prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year 's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that today 's relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the u.s. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages the latest weekly hughes tool co <ht> rig count a barometer of the oil industry 's health showed 761 u.s. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year in 1986 the hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-world war ii low of 663 in july as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times ike kerridge a hughes economist said " in 1986 the united states replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate wo n't be any better this year " he added " we do n't have the options we do with oil imports of gas from canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost " only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while u.s. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet according to industry estimates george gaspar an oil analyst with robert w. baird and co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in u.s. drilling " we anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies that means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988 " gaspar said gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in december of 1989 much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the gulf of mexico where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years some of the industry 's biggest companies such as exxon corp <xon> mobil corp mob and union texas petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the gulf of mexico crandall said for example conoco inc a dupont <dd> subsidiary will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the gulf of mexico 's deepest production plat form which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day but t. boone pickens who has acquired huge texas and kansas gas reserves for his mesa limited partnership <mlp> in recent months is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery pickens predicts the u.s. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do " the rigs wo n't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barre l " said pickens 58 adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. tenneco inc <tgt> one of the largest u.s. gas producers is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists tenneco vice president joe foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the u.s. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years ' supply current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement he said reuter

warned the u.s. house of representatives that tough trade legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by u.s. trading partners the warning was sent in a letter from sir roy denman head of the ec delegation in washington to dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee a copy of the letter was made available to reuters denman told rostenkowski an illinois democrat he backed aspects of the bill such as one backing new talks under the gatt and one excluding protection for the textile industry but denman disagreed with other provisions which would require president reagan to take retaliatory trade action against nations with large trade surpluses with the u.s. and would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade practices denman told rostenkowski that gatt regulations prohibit member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in trade disputes unless the action is gatt-approved he said " if the congress makes retaliatory action mandatory then the united states would be in violation of its international legal obligations and on a collision course with its major trading partners " denman added that a president should have flexibility in enforcing trade laws saying " in the last resort any administration must take its decision in light of the overall national interest " otherwise he said " the risk would be counter-reaction by trading partners of the united states i.e. retaliation or enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against imports from the united states " denman also said congress could prompt retaliation if it reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for firms to file unfair trade practice claims retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards for findings that imports were injuring u.s. firms " changes in these standards must be agreed upon multilaterally they cannot be imposed by the united states alone on the world trading system " he said house leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb imports of cloth and clothing similar to a measure passed two years ago but vetoed by president reagan there was concern by the leaders that reagan would veto the entire trade bill because of the textile amendment reuter

international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus international monetary sources said at a meeting this week in paris senior government officials from major nations are considering an organisation for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) staff report that forecasts a continuing large japanese trade surplus they said though japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen 's sharp rise against the dollar they still tend to surge when growth picks up according to the oecd. as a solution the oecd staff has urged japan to redirect its export-driven economy boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy they said that recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the international monetary fund 's executive board the monetary sources said japan 's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country 's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members the united states which until recently has been reluctant to criticize japan 's fiscal stance joined in the attack he said the imf staff has also cast doubt on the japanese government 's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning april 1 most independent forecasters including the imf believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct monetary sources said the finance ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen 's rise the yen 's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge american market tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen foreign minister tadashi kuranari said recently the yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar most japanese politicians including finance minister kiichi miyazawa are clearly hoping the yen will weaken government officials said at a meeting in paris last month britain canada france japan the united states and west germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels officials said that wording represented a compromise miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months before it weakens later in the year japan wanted the paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar perhaps by substituting the word " recent " for " current " while the united states wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar 's weaker levels now perhaps by use of the word " present " they said in the months leading up the february 22 agreement the dollar dropped some 10 yen the officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent u.s. action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the u.s. currency japan has also attacked oecd forecasts which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen officials said there are already signs of that more and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad they said reuter

formally transmitted to congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments in a letter to the congressional leadership accompanying the " sugar program improvements act of 1987 " peter myers deputy agriculture secretary said the reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991 the payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs myers said the administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the house of representatives next week by rep. john porter r-ill congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the house or senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist the direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years it also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower for example on the first 350 tons of production a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 4.5 cts in 1989 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991 the income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years whichever is less usda said myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry he said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads u.s. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a " progressive contraction " of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year he said this has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing furthermore usda said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage the result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of u.s. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar usda also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on u.s. consumers and industrial users in fiscal 1987 usda said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar " enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing " myers said the following table lists the rate of payments in cts per lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons recoverable raw sugar under the administration 's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments quantity 1988 1989 1990 1991 first 350 tons 6.000 4.500 3.000 1.500 over 350 to 700 5.750 4.313 2.875 1.438 over 700 to 1,000 5.500 4.125 2.750 1.375 over 1,000 to 1,500 5.000 3.750 2.500 1.250 over 1,500 to 3,000 4.500 3.375 2.250 1.125 over 3,000 to 6,000 3.500 2.625 1.750 0.875 over 6,000 to 10,000 2.250 1.688 1.125 0.563 over 10,000 to 20,000 0.500 0.375 0.250 0.125 over 20,000 tons nil nil nil nil reuter

over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month 's paris pact extend to keeping down european interest rates banking economists said but in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate west germany 's economy they said the paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said economists speculated that g-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling u.s. and west german interest rates further when they meet for the imf interim committee in april " the recent round of monetary accommodation by the bundesbank and the bank of japan and the firming of the federal funds rate are significant they mark an uncoupling of movements in u.s. and foreign interest rates " salomon bros inc said in a recent study it said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar 's fall these spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabil ized west german bundesbank president karl otto poehl encouraged the u.s. not to cut interest rates in january when the bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar west german economists see room for further cuts in leading west german rates if the dollar resumes its decline " it 's not a taboo " peter pietsch spokesman for commerzbank ag said but most economists see room for a cut in west german rates only in the first half of the year as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year the bundesbank 's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year 's low last week yields fell to around 5.50 pct not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-april economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates which has become more pronounced since the bundesbank lowered its discount rate it might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the bundesbank 's central bank money stock aggregate but conflicting with this trend are plans to increase west german tax cuts part of the paris currency pact designed to meet u.s. demands for faster west german growth this move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing this may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending josef koerner chief economist of the west german ifo-institut said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the west german government in november any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up but coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar 's decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of bonn 's tax reform package the west german government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion west german chancellor helmut kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said last thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes but few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing the bundesbank said in its february report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits the bundesbank said west german public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985 the federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures and also drew on two billion marks of bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter reuter

promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year private economists say some of the slowness experienced in the october-december period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year as the tax law changes that went into effect in january slowed business and consumer spending but some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the u.s. economy although some economists remain cautious about the outlook the commerce department reported today that new orders for durable goods in february jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs a six pct rise to 101.2 billion dlrs even excluding volatile defense goods durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct the agency said the february numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct the january/february employment statistics suggest the gross national product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year said lyle gram ley an economist with the mortgage bankers association the u.s. jobless rate in february and january was 6.7 pct the lowest rate since march 1980 the number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in february after a 319,000 gain in january and a 225,000 december increase the government said the employment data suggests a gnp annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter said gram ley much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter gramley said he expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending he also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units fidelity bank senior economist mickey levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue levy predicts gnp will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987 accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter the key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the u.s. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar 's value over the last year and half " the improvement will be gradual and long lasting " levy predicted most of it will be through import reduction but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of u.s. goods become more attractive overseas the reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit which soared to record levels last year will improve this year and the u.s. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year as part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit the u.s. has been pressing west germany and japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the u.s. and others u.s. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the united states whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries the u.s. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt the government last week said the u.s. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter there were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the united states and those shipped abroad the report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms the u.s. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986 while fourth quarter economic growth was weak corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period the government said it also reported that inflation as measured by the gnp price deflator remained in check growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period the lowest rise in 19 years the government also reported that consumer spending a key element of the five year economic recovery jumped 1.7 pct in february after falling two pct in january the federal reserve board also reported that the

in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except dallas where orders remained sluggish chase

oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies the ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the reagan administration 's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment the administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of alaska since december 1980 a federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the bering sea off alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native eskimos but the supreme court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration " here injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable " justice byron white wrote for the court " and on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined " he said the oil companies amoco corp <an> arco exxon corp <xon> mobil corp <mob> sohio shell texaco inc <tx> and union oil had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses the first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs administration officials saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources the alaskan villages of gambell and stebbins along with an organization of eskimo natives on the yukon delta argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing reuter

test the strength of the paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement analysts said since the six-nation accord last month sterling has risen sharply adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index while the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high u.k. interest rates but analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the paris accord seen yesterday the market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively the paris accord could collapse "on balance sterling would be a net sufferer if g-6 collapses " phillips and drew analyst stephen lewis said he said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies however although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling none were expecting a very sharp drop in the u.k. currency sterling remained supported by optimism on the u.k. political and economic outlook firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates they said bullish sentiment on the u.k. economic outlook has been running especially high after last week 's budget seen as popular both with the markets and with british voters sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the west german and japanese economies where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the u.k. recent opinion polls showing britain 's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound in addition sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in u.k. bank base lending rates in less than two weeks a further half-point cut widely expected in the next week or so has already been largely discounted u.k. base rates now running at 10 pct are still relatively high compared to other western countries and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar 's decline dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets however were reflected in the u.k. government bond ( gilt ) market where prices dropped by up to 5/1 6 point until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this thursday 's u.k. current account figures for february market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after january 's small surplus reuter

cooperative futures co. the futures trading arm of many midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years will vote wednesday on its possible dissolution the directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month citing falling volume and increasing costs sources close to the organization told reuters the pullout of growmark inc. which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock led to the call for dissolution the possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership ironically it was growmark at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators that founded illinois cooperative futures on december 1 1960 but growmark became affiliated last year with archer daniels midland of decatur ill. and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies adm/grow mark with that relationship growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative said tom mulligan president of the co-op membership in the company which mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives has declined from 99 in 1982 a notable loss was agriindustries of iowa which became affiliated with cargill inc. illinois co-op 's other members include such regional cooperatives as indiana grain based in indianapolis goldkist of atlanta ga. midstates in toledo ohio farmland industries in kansas city mo. farmers commodities des moines and harvest states in minneapolis some observors said the demise of illinois cooperative futures co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system instead of banding together the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways said the floor manager of one cash house at the chicago board of trade such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant he said don hanes vice president for communications with the national council of farm cooperatives said 5,600 cooperatives exist today down from 6,700 five years ago " the period we 've gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch " he said " there 's been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops " one problem he said is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export rather than exporting it themselves losing potential profits but exporting grain requires heavy investments and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by farmers export co. a co-op set up to export grains served " to make folks gun-shy " hanes said mulligan said he believes the dissolution if it is approved is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in u.s. agricultural economics a grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm " was a convenience something that saved us a little bit of money ( its dissolution ) will force us to change our way of doing business " " we 're sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside " he said " but there are lot of people out there to do business with there are plenty of capable firms " steven w. cavanaugh vice president for grain marketing with indiana grain said he would prefer to trade futures through a chicago-based cooperative " in terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals there would be economic savings " he said but added " the times change and with changing times come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around " cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability " i would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble it is a sound healthy organization " in the year ended february 28 1986 the illinois cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members ' equity or net worth of 8.3 mln dlrs the annual report for the most recent year has not been filed under the cooperative system income from operations is returned as " patronage refunds " to the members income and refunds in the past five years have been declining in the year ended february 28 1982 the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs patronage refunds in the year ended february 28 1986 totalled 9.5 mln dlrs "you 're dealing with substantially lower volume " mulligan said " lower volume translates into higher costs " according to the company 's 1986 annual report growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of illinois cooperative futures co. mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital growmark is entitled to he said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution equity is distributed according to each member 's trading volume and as a result changes from year to year however mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if growmark pulled out reuter

board paul volcker has written to the chairman of the house banking committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration wednesday volcker told committee chairman fernand st. germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant u.s. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against u.s. firms abroad he added " even japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed " has started opening its markets in his letter made available at the treasury volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was a problem " i believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt " volcker said it might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said volcker said he endorsed comments by treasury secretary james baker "about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facilit y " he also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates " is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects " " for example the bill 's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations " volcker said he recommended " we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations " on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in paris between u.s. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies reuter

surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the international wheat council ( iwc ) says in its latest monthly report faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the united states the iwc says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters argentina australia canada the ec and the u.s. in some countries for example australia and argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production a policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long period this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency for example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 european currency units ( ecus ) it dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 the high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 this was partly due to increased production in china and india the period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the argentina the u.s. and australia by lower acreages in argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower u.s. acreages are attributed to official incentives reuter

showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg up from a 73 mln surplus in january has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates analysts said market forecasts had been for a worse outcome with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg against the official figure of 224 mln stg sharply narrower than january 's 527 mln deficit " the figures are unreservedly good " chase manhattan securities economist andrew wroblewski said sterling rebounded on the trade figures reversing a weaker morning trend to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday unchanged from yesterday 's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 gmt level the market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling which has been the motor behind the recent fall in u.k. interest rates money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards but sentiment now looks to have turned about again there now looks to be no danger that the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded said wroblewski seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in february to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in january exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion however chris tinker u.k. analyst at brokers phillips and drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months he forecast the chancellor 's budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods however ian harwood economist at warburg securities said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg he said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the confederation of british industry the growth in imports appears to be flattening even if january 's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres harwood said u.k. government bonds or gilts surged by more than 1/2 point on the bett er-than-expected news as earlier worries about the figures evaporated sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 gmt nearly a cent higher than the european low of 1.5960 however analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the conservative government 's support was slipping the marplan poll published in " today " showed conservative support had fallen to 36 pct from 38 pct last month while the alliance of liberals and social democrats had rallied to 31 pct from 21 pct to run neck and neck with the labour party whose own support fell from 38 pct the poll was taken after the budget which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent political observers said another regular poll is due tomorrow and eonomists warn that today 's improved sentiment could be dented if support for prime minister margaret thatcher slips again this upsetting of the markets ' political perceptions which are all but discounting a conservative victory in the upcoming general election made them more sensitive to the trade data harwood said " the news did come as a very very substantial relief " he said however on the interest rate front economists caution that lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall they noted lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed reuter

foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country 's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the general agreeement on tariffs and trade ( gatt ) said by stressing its record trade deficit of 169.8 billion dlrs last year the u.s. was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report the fundamental problem the size of the u.s. federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said gatt also predicted world trade would grow by only 2.5 pct in 1987 a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years gatt experts urged washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit raising u.s. trade barriers " would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit it would however increase inflation and reduce world trade " it said " the basic cause some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit would remain " the report said gatt economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in japan and some west european nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher u.s. inflation concerns over third world debt management and looming protectionism the report also said imbalances in the current accounts of japan west germany and the u.s. had increased in 1986 the most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added " th us the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year " the report said gatt warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the u.s. inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar " such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade " but the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the united states despite the dollar 's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive it suggested that resources idle in the u.s. both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad world trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986 about half of the rate of the previous year trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade gatt said developing countries ' exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet gatt said the combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them ( chile colombia philippines south korea and thailand ) had higher exports reuter

something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar 's fall against the yen by departing last sunday from the language of the paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability

monetary policy begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986 will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter analysts said a poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower with the fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy " the fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession " said raymond stone chief financial economist at merrill lynch capital markets stone said economic data available by late june may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut but he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point to avoid hurting the dollar further all of the economists agreed that the federal open market committee tomorrow will leave fed policy unchanged the average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of june in both the treasury bond yield to 7-1/2 pct and the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another to 5- 7/8 pct most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct other broad predictions of the survey relating mainly to the april-june quarter follow the dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large u.s. budget deficit and a wide but narrowing trade gap contacted after the dollar 's steep drop in the last two business days the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more rather than less than they expect oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987 stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise the outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up inflation as measured by the gnp implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986 the sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year u.s. real gross national product which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves first-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter robert brusca of nikko securities co international sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. he expects real gnp which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986 to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter " the economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect " brusca said he said an involuntary buildup in inventories largely in autos will add to first-quarter economic growth with consumer spending helping later " we 're running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat " said philip braverman of irving securities corp. his interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter gnp growth respectively he expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories lower capital investment slow government spending and less construction only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth he sees a 7.10 pct end-of-june yield on treasury bonds with federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct respectively nikko 's brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar 's fall to 40-year

bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds both nicho and resler left their end-june prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct the higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that japanese investors will be less eager to buy

ico executive board meeting starts in london today delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote international agreements exist for sugar and wheat these do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements collect statistics and draw up market analyses analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat an alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups made up of governments with advice from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber the u.n. common fund for commodities with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to become operational because neither the u.s. nor the soviet union has ratified it u.s.

expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case u.s. officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests " we see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward " official administration policy states the u.s. currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses the international coffee agreement ( ica ) and inra but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts the u.s. did not join the international cocoa agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries the state department said u.s. officials singled out the inra as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working u.s. negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement u.s. officials said canadian officials in ottawa

ministry of agriculture and delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements peter baron told reuters in london " agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality if there was full participation by producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously " but baron added " no real sanctions are available for a country that does n't stick to its obligations ...the german approach is sceptical we do n't think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries they were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them " traditionally britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with third world producing countries but recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for " intellectual honesty " and " objective criteria " have grown british officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid it is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they

united states and japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin but they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip or whether this week 's falling share prices mark the start of a " bear " market " it 's the billion dollar question " said richard o'brien economist at american express international bank in london japan 's trade surplus 92.7 billion dlrs last year has poured into share and bond markets around the world and funded a good chunk of the huge u.s. budget deficit around a third of any new sale of u.s. treasury bonds has been bought by the japanese however japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the united states lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit the counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the u.s. increases duties on japanese electronic goods may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit and if the u.s. trade deficit does fall the japanese will have less money to invest to entice u.s. investors to fill the gap that would be left if the japanese stopped buying u.s. bonds interest rates would have to soar o'brien said the subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets " a year ago we could be pretty confident about the markets " said o'brien " now it is much less certain " buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy but the world economy with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations a massive load of third world debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape said o'brien nevertheless new york analyst william raferty of smith barney harris upham said " we 're still in a bull market ," adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and " the bear usually strikes slowly " economist evelyn brody at morgan grenfell and co in london said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices although interest by the japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it 's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in u.s. dollars and especially the u.s. treasury ( bond ) market according to david butcher a senior executive at yamaichi securities co ltd 's bond operation in london he said the japanese are paying much closer attention now to the french franc and west german mark in the longer run he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar 's slide will mean for securities markets reuter

over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base " what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes " says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so-called fixed rate system scuttled in the early 1970s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration 's chief economic architect has preferred to use the so-called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say 30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis " in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased " he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world-wide basis so "that an index has a relevance for the entire world " he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes " focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions " he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter

farmland as we have done since 1980 there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on " xu jinfeng a middle-aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the world 's population but only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned china into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985 and again in 1986 but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year it gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years " we lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began " official xu said " since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up " " l ast year we lost land to a new railway line " xu said but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added the issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the peking leadership which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year " the present situation of abusing occupying unlaw fully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious " said an article in the official press explaining the new measures " it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland " it said " china has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient " an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china 's people get enough grain to eat the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops to offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china 's 200 mln city residents rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices chen z u yuan communist party secretary of a village in the eastern province of zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of " selfish city people " and could raise city grain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out a price rise " raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability " said a china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term " we must be very careful we have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises " he said " the problem is how to do it " the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late 1970s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land "as the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future " the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it for most of the period of communist rule the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative " new measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment " the newspaper said reuter

offer subsidized wheat to the soviet union appears to have reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to secretary of state george shultz' visit later this month to moscow rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat markets since officials from the two countries held their customary semi-annual grain talks in february moscow 's decision at that time to reenter the u.s. corn market strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects shultz is set to arrive in moscow april 13 shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the export enhancement program eep coupled with the announcement of his visit to moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the reagan administration was preparing an offer administration officials in and out of the u.s. agriculture department have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer but usda officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer while not a " done deal " is a live possibility prominent u.s. grain trade representatives many of whom asked not to be identified continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible are saying they would not rule one out rep. pat roberts r-kan. yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks aides to roberts said he had spoken to republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials richard fritz director of international marketing at u.s. wheat associates said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer washington made peking earlier this year when usda approved subsidies to china of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more soviet purchases of u.s. corn and open the door to u.s. sales of soybeans as ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the soviets subsidized wheat but were embarrassed when moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left u.s. wheat prices far above world market prices the administration 's decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism grain trade sources said nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent shultz from saying the soviets were " chortling " because washington was offering soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to u.s. housewives the conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer combined with continued hard times in the u.s. grain belt would favor a subsidy offer in addition the ussr has made it clear it would consider buying u.s. wheat if it were priced more competitively however observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration 's announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer up until the time of the announc ment congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the white house had decided to expand the export enhancement program to include not only the soviets but also a much broader list of countries instead the administration scaled back the offer to include only the soviets that last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the soviet union reuter

massive central bank purchases is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment dealers and analysts said central banks may succeed in slowing a trend but without accompanying policy changes they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day the sources said " timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention " said jim o'neill a financial markets economist with marine midland banks inc. the importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention after citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct the first change in the rate since last august the dollar started to advance and reached a high in tokyo of 147.50 yen up two yen from tuesday 's new york low by contrast monetary authorities spearheaded by the bank of japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of march but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low monday of 144.70 yen some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar the market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray but is no longer mesmerized " they 've lost their credibility the market feels it can take on the central banks and win " said michael snow head of treasury operations at union bank of switzerland in new york the relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the september 22 1985 plaza accord then however central banks had an easy time of it because the markets and the treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances now there is no such consensus the market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the u.s. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement while japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries for its part the united states is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the february paris agreement of the group of five plus canada to foster stability dealers say specifically they said the fed 's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted designed more as a political gesture to japan than to strike fear into the markets " it 's been pro-forma intervention " said francoise soares-kemp chief corporate trader at credit lyonnais because of this discord and the market 's momentum for a lower dollar analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail " it 's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar ( at these levels ) ," said snow who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation " there have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars " added " b u ying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it " late last decade during the presidency of jimmy carter when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks analysts said snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely " i do n't think anybody has the stomach for it because they saw the futility of it in the seventies " indeed because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market trading volume in london new york and tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day according to a joint central bank study about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the group of thirty private research group there are signs that central banks too realize the futility of swimming against the tide bank of japan sources told reuters in tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks are being considered " in this era of financial liberalization it 's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of japan ," one senior official in tokyo said reuter

week u.s. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term financial analysts said however some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar they said "as the dollar goes so goes the bond market ," said dean witter analyst karen gibbs the recent decline in the dollar which hit a 40-year low against the japanese yen monday was reversed wednesday when several large u.s. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct " even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over " gibbs said the dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation indeed the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the federal reserve 's policy making arm the federal open market committee this week analysts said " to the fed the combination of a falling dollar a steepening yield curve and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation " said denis karnosky analyst at carroll mcentee and mcginley inc. such expectations could mean that " a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration " at the fomc meeting he said any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening karnosky said rather the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window he said borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months he said in the meantime however " the market looks a bit oversold " said jim wysoglad analyst at golden gate futures wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive june bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32 technician leslie keefe of technical data corp of boston said that the key test for june bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32 " all previous selloffs since mid-november have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level " keefe said if that level is broken and the dollar continues to decline keefe said she expects the june bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93 the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984 reuter

stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in paris in february had been successful and would be continued stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week 's international monetary fund meeting in washington that " the strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments " stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 1.80 marks created problems for west germany 's exports stoltenberg said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the u.s. and in japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy " no-one would benefit if after years of over-valuation the u.s. dollar fell into the other extreme that is strong under-valuation " he said stoltenberg said west germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the u.s. and japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors asked whether he believed the markets would test the paris currency accord stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in paris had not been published the paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered he said he had nothing further to add stoltenberg also appeared to suggest that west germany was now no longer under any pressure from the u.s. government to stimulate its economy he declined to respond specifically to a question on this subject but said " you must attach particular importance to the consensus which was reached in paris " the minister nevertheless added that he would make clear during his trip to washington that west germany 's nominal trade figures gave a false impression about actual trade flows stoltenberg noted that in 1986 bonn 's exports fell by a nominal two pct while its nominal imports fell by 10.7 pct west germany 's imports dropped largely because of foreign currency developments and the cheaper price of oil and led to a record trade surplus last year however stoltenberg said that in real terms west germany 's exports by volume had increased by 1.5 pct while real imports had risen by a much stronger 6.2 pct in this way west germany had made its contribution to economic stability stoltenberg added stoltenberg noted the government expected imports to rise by a real four to five pct in 1987 with exports stagnating he said it was too early to revise official forecasts for west germany 's economic growth this year the government has forecast an unchanged 2.5 pct rise in gross national product the kiel institute a leading research body is still expecting growth of three pct but some other research institutes have revised forecasts down to below two pct stoltenberg said the wide range of predictions showed how many imponderables had to be taken into account and said no drastic changes in official forecasts were needed reuter

closest aide deputy treasury secretary richard darman will not change the course of washington 's domestic and international economic policies u.s. officials said darman who has worked alongside baker for six years was widely credited with helping him mastermind initiatives on currency management and international economic cooperation u.s. officials said darman also played a key role in shepherding president reagan 's sweeping tax reform plan through the u.s. congress but they flatly dismissed suggestions that his departure to the investment banking firm of shearson lehman brothers signaled the baker team was breaking up or that the treasury secretary himself might leave soon " it really does not mean that he took the opportunity as it came up ," one official said another commented " b aker will miss him but he 's not going to stand in his way " there has been widespread speculation since last autumn that darman sought a wall street job officials said darman felt the passage of tax reform late last year marked an appropriate moment to bow out baker acknowledged darman would be sorely missed "dick darman has contributed mightily to the success of this administration over the past six years and his departure represents a substantial loss " he said u.s. officials admitted darman 's absence would be an undoubted blow to baker who has relied on him for policy advice both at the white house and in reagan 's second term at the treasury one aide once described darman as " indispensable " to baker baker is widely thought to want a more stable currency system and darman is generally credited by officials of other nations as baker 's leading theorist on this issue favouring target zones to limit currency fluctuations earlier this year monetary sources said the u.s. treasury unsuccessfully sounded out allies on a target zone system but a u.s. official disputed the assessment that with darman gone baker would abandon international initiatives baker 's work as head of reagan 's economic policy council spearheading trade policy and his skills in negotiating with the democrat-controlled congress will go on as before darman 's strength was not as an economist but as a political strategist " and that 's baker 's strength too " the official said there were already indications that baker who throughout his time in government has relied on a closely-knit circle of advisers has moved swiftly to find a successor one possibility is that baker might turn to george gould who holds the number three treasury position of under-secretary gould another close confidante has known baker for years before joining the treasury in november 1985 gould was a partner at the wall steet firm of wertheim and co and formerly headed donaldson lufkin and jenrette securities corp. the darman announcement came on the eve of the semi-annual meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank where many policies darman helped shape will be debated he helped baker devise the september 1985 plaza agreement when the united states japan west germany france and britain curbed the dollar 's strength the pact was a major turning point in u.s. policy ending a period of disdain for economic cooperation and intervention in currency markets darman also worked on some other baker initiatives like the tokyo summit agreement to intensify coordination of economic policies among the leading industrial countries and the recent paris agreement to stabilise currencies and stimulate global growth these policies are collectively aimed at redressing the huge gap between japan and west germany 's trade surpluses and the united state 's massive trade deficit that policy goal still remains a prime objective of the reagan administration and will not change with darman 's departure reuter

wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough sartaj aziz special assistant on food and agriculture to the pakistani prime minister said in an interview no exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price he said aziz forecast that pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable the government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices and the land would be better used for other crops aziz said the pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds the aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years he said aziz said the current 1986/87 crop harvesting of which is just beginning is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes this compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year 's yield of 14.0 mln he said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly the long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993 taking into account pakistan 's annual population growth rate of more than three pct current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes the current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes aziz said this compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes which pakistan will maintain at all costs and a " strategic reserve " target of two mln tonnes despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target the surplus will not be exported at present he said the government wants to keep an extra " safety margin " until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption new exports will be considered only in about a year 's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well he said the new domestic policy introduced on march 15 is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo with other costs this means a price in pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo under the old system introduced during world war two and due to be phased out by april 15 some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills the ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended aziz said prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system the wheat price in karachi the most expensive pakistani city had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on march 1 to 2.85 rupees on march 30 aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran reuter

expressed concern that trade protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the united states and japan might spread throughout the industrial world but in an interview with reuters conable said the action by the united states to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war conable said the world bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth " we have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world does n't close at the same time ," he said he said the u.s. action against japan was " a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy " the interview came just before next week 's semi-annual meetings of the bank and the international monetary fund referring to brazil 's recent interest payments moratorium conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched he said the bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform the bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government 's role in the economy " we 're comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio " conable said he made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall bank lending for some time he noted " the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt " conable is a a former republican congressman from new york chosen by president reagan for the bank position last year he is an associate of treasury secertary james baker who launched the u.s. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in october 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the world bank conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the bank 's organization to be completed in the next several weeks he said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by conable and is being closely-watched by the agency 's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities " i want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow " conable said however he said " i do n't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and i do n't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose " he said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by baker has given the bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis conable added that cooperation between the bank and its sister agency the international monetary fund was good and that he talked often with imf managing director michel camdessus on a variety of issues on a personal level conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the bank noting that " i do n't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development " he added " so i do n't feel a great calling to personalize the institution " on the development needs of sub-sahara africa conable said that the bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for bank 's international development association was earmarked for africa leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the sub-sahara during next week 's meetings reuter

detracted from u.s. march non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the federal reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar economists said u.s. march non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000 less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected manufacturing employment fell 25,000 compared with february 's 50,000 gain while march construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in february " the momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter ," said stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc. " this sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters " " the fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy ," he said " they will not ease as long the dollar is weak but clearly they ca n't tighten " david wyss of data resources inc said that the downward revision in february non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected while wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real u.s. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct he said the march jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct bill sullivan of dean witter reynolds inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000 compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 " there 's momentum in first quarter labor force activity but less than assumed " he said " gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best this rules out any possibilty of the fed tightening for exchange-related purposes " in march the average workweek fell back to its january level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in february manufacturing hours also fell back to their january level totalling 40.9 hours in march compared with 41.2 hours in february the commerce department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in march was concentrated in automobile electrical and electronic manufacturing robert brusca of nikko securities international said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter gnp accounts roach said he expects first quarter u.s. gnp to rise two pct to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters he said the march drop in industrial activity " is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to gnp " economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for march they expect only marginal gains if not small declines for these indicators compared with a february increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income steve slifer of lehman government securities said the drop in march construction employment may also signal a drop in march housing starts which rose 2.6 pct in february to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in january the rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct its lowest level since march 1980 from 6.7 pct in february but wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force which fell to 119.2 mln in march from 119.35 mln in february " this just means that there were fewer people looking for work so the drop in unemployment does n't mean much ," he said he said the latest employment report will not concern the fed because it does points to gnp growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct but " it does suggest they ca n't afford to tighten to quickly eith e r " the statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated march labor force gains just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in january and february slifer said but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter gnp growth economic growth remains sluggish but silfer does not think that the federal open market committee changed policy at their meeting this week " at some point they will be more inclined to ease " he said for the time being however the march employment report " increases the likelihood they wo n't tighten regardless of the dollar " reuter

finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the european monetary system ( ems ) against international market turbulence officials said " there was a general will to reinforce the european monetary system with all that implies " belgian finance minister mark eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this belgian coastal resort the gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of ems parities within nine months in january the system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant ems currency the west german mark sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system but eyskens said february 's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the ec to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the ems he told a news conference yesterday 's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among ems member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries they also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable both when they reached their fixed ems limits and within their agreed margins but eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in luxembourg in june on the basis of proposals from the ec 's monetary committee and committee of central bank governors he said the ec needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates the belgian minister whose country presently holds the presidency of the community made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the ems towards the ec 's long term goal of economic and monetary integration " we have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system " eyskens said eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the ems has to be reinforced if the ec 's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead ec executive commission president jacques delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in october that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to " dedramatise " realignments of ems parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers however west german sources said bonn finance minister gerhard stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves he said several ems member countries believed the ems would work better if central banks held each other 's currencies an issue of particular importance regarding west germany since the bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves he said the debate on dedramatising ems realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the january reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory the realignment was marked by acrimony between france and west germany with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul reuter

industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986 the international energy agency ( iea ) said oil use in the 24 countries of the oecd increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd the iea said in its monthly oil market report growth in oecd countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels as in 1986 but if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year 's 3.6 pct it said the iea said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels some destocking by end-users can be expected if that happens natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels iea estimates on april 1 put oil stocks in the oecd area at 428 mln tonnes representing 98 days of forward consumption this is about the same level as at the begining of the year the agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks it said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in oecd countries in the first quarter of the year this followed a small rise in january of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in february and 2.5 mln bpd in march it is possible that final data will show a larger draw particulary for march it said as crude production also fell there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks particularly at sea the iea said company stocks on land in the oecd rose to 326 mln tonnes on april 1 against 316 mln on april 1 1986 governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period the year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising more or less in line with consumption after declining for five years the iea noted oil stocks on land in the u.s. and canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on april 1 down from the 214 mln tonnes on january 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption respectively oil stocks in western europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on april 1 down from the 154 mln on january 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption world oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986 this drop was mostly due to a decline in opec crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in february/m arch from 16.5 mln bpd in january and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned economies the iea said total opec crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter plus 1.4 mln bpd of ng ls compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986 supply from non-opec countries totalled 28 mln bpd against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986 a drop in saudi arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in march from 3.6 mln bpd in february was the largest factor behind the opec production decline the iea said saudi arabia "s opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd reuter

mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates mueller said in an article for the boersen zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy the article followed international press speculation that the bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy mueller a member of the bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in bavaria noted that the bundesbank 's decision in january to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targe tting " simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy " he explained mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation the bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down lower money market rates achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts mueller said the measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path he said " finally of course and there is no need to keep this quiet the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months " he added " all in all the bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the january discount rate cut despite suppositions to the contrary " mueller said " keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad rather than growth in bank credits is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks " mueller said now that west germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate in any case the exchange rate partly depends on u.s. currency and budgetary policy and the u.s. e c on omy he said but an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the bundesbank even interest rates are not in the centre of the bundesbank 's considerations but reflect competition and other market conditions mueller said a cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock the bundesbank 's main money supply indicator this does not reflect banking liquidity but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the bundesbank 's instruments mueller said the less dependent non-banks are on bank credits the harder it is to steer money supply this has increasingly been the case recently because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports " if the bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows " he said mueller said growth in money supply was still too high in the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct down from 10 pct in the previous quarter the growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth pointing to the success of the current policy he said but high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities " monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy nothing else " he said reuter

semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in u.s. tariffs on japanese electronic goods set to take effect april 17 industry analysts said the move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said " prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the japanese semiconductor industry " analyst drew peck of donaldson lufkin and jenrette said but analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether japan would be successful in forcing japanese companies to cut production in the long run others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs " we 've seen the grey market begin to dry up for d-rams and it has virtually dried up for eproms, " said merrill lynch analyst thomas kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers " prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching " kurlack added industry analysts said japan 's ministry of international trade and industry or miti had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year 's semiconductor accord with the u.s. the reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on japanese electronic goods alleging that japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the u.s. market but some analysts said japan 's attempt to mollify the u.s. was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the u.s. as production in japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the u.s. and few american semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips u.s. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured " the japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from washington but at the same time they 're demonstating their muscle " analyst peck said the cut backs in japanese production are expected to benefit u.s. chip makers " i think this could be a very important factor for u.s. semiconductor manufacturers " industry analyst elliot levine of ladenburg thalmann co said but analyst peck said " it will take a few weeks to see whether japan has genuinely cut production " he said japanese manufactures were likely to view miti 's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment reuter

certificates or " certs " for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs department of agriculture undersecretary daniel amstutz said speaking at a house agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs however the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs he said without the use of certificates amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the commodity credit corporation ccc in addition 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from ccc inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory he said when asked to comment on a recent study by the general accounting office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government amstutz said " gao underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs " of the certificate program amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures gao underestimated this net loan activity amstutz said " there is no question in the mind of the department of agriculture that these certificates have been very useful " amstutz said immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity improved market price competitiveness higher farm income and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs he said certificates are an integral part of usda 's long-range market-oriented farm policy he said amstutz told subcommittee chairman rep. dan glickman d-kans. that usda is in the process of preparing an official response to the gao study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed reuter

finance ministers meeting in washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the international monetary market but any such agreement will need to go beyond the paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures financial analysts said " if they ( the finance ministers ) give the market something really new to look at that is some package that goes beyond the paris agreement you could have a real boost in the dollar " said shearson lehman brothers analyst anne mills on the other hand " anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar " mills said traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar nor will central bank intervention " a lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar " said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the imm " if there is no concrete resolution they will be looking to sell the dollar possibly down to the 1.80 mark level " he said technically most currency futures are poised for another rise said smith barney harris upham analyst craig sloane sloane noted that june yen futures set a new contract high on tuesday and closed at its best level ever while june sterling set a new contract high on monday " everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you do n't need much to get things rolling " sloane said in particular the june canadian dollar for which sloane recently put out a buy recommen dation has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside a close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout sloane said and would likely mean the nearby canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level june canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 tuesday mills noted however that interest rate differentials between canadian securities and u.s. securities have narrowed dramatically recently with yields on 10-year canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above u.s. 10-year notes what has helped the canadian currency she noted is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the canadian equity market particularly from japanese investors other analysts however said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally " something will be done at the ( g-5 and g-7 ) meeting to calm people ," said david horner of merrill lynch economics the paris accord has pretty much fixed where major european currencies will trade horner said but sterling futures may still make another run for new highs up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the june contract on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before british elections and possibly another interest rate cut horner said the june british pound closed at 1.6080 on tuesday horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the g-5 and g-7 meetings the most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen horner said in yen futures the bottom of the dollar 's range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the june contract june yen closed at 0.006913 on tuesday if such a range does emerge from the meetings " we will have one more rally in the yen " horner said reuter

said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained west german economic growth in a speech to the institute of contempory german affairs here poehl said " it would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit " he said the united states could face a vicious circle of depreciation inflation and more depreciation if it took that route poehl noted west germany had already taken steps to meet u.s. demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy accelerating tax cuts cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth he said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for january 1988 to the beginning of this year but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the west german parliament but there were also limits to the impact west germany could accept on exports from a rising mark he said poehl said west germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home " a further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth ," he said poehl said the bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade had given some extra leeway but poehl said west germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy the underlying rate of inflation was now two pct not the reported negative inflation rates last year and west germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments " for the time being we will have to focus our policy more on the external side and we can live with a more expansionary money supply but we must be very careful " he said he said he shared some of the u.s. concern about japan 's trade surpluses which affected european countries as well as the united states poehl welcomed the so-called louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries saying the importance of the february 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated all partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level and that further changes would damage growth he said " this was a remarkable change in attitude especially on the part of our american colleagues " he said but he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar 's value could overshoot reuter
